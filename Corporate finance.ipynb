       "  'body': \"1. Introduction\\nCo-opted directors are those who joined the board after the CEO assumed office (Coles et al., 2014). Due to the timing of their appointment, these co-opted directors may be allegiant to the CEO who appointed them. This arises from the CEO's authoritative position in the firm's corporate hierarchy, which may allow them to wield significant power over board member selection decisions. This suggests that co-opted directors' impartialness on monitoring and other directorial decisions may be influenced in part by their allegiance to the CEO. Therefore, being co-opted has the potential to inhibit the individual director's role as an effective monitor. Moreover, as the fraction of co-opted directors on the board increases, it may also reduce the board's monitoring quality. This would weaken the corporate board as an instrument for quality governance.\\nThis study builds on the argument that co-opted boards are less effective monitors. Coles et al. (2014) reported that turnover-performance sensitivity decreases and pay increases when the fraction of co-opted directors on the board increases. Coles et al. (2014) also showed that CEOs from firms with a higher fraction of co-opted directors are less likely to be fired after a period of poor performance, and non-co-opted independent directors are more effective in monitoring. Follow-up papers have shown that board co-option leads to higher R&D investments (Chintrakarn et al., 2016), lower dividend payouts (Jiraporn and Lee, 2018), and a lower likelihood of firms adopting clawback provisions (Huang et al., 2019). Overall, empirical evidence posited a negative relationship between board co-option and board monitoring effectiveness.\\nOur study investigates the relationship between board co-option and covenant intensity of loan contracts (ex ante), and subsequent likelihood of covenant violations of these loans (ex post). Covenants are tools used in loan contracts to assist lenders in monitoring the borrower (Chava and Roberts, 2008; Jensen and Meckling, 1976; Smith and Warner, 1979). It has been empirically documented that firm-level board quality characteristics affect loan contract price and non-price terms, e.g. loan size, maturity, and covenant requirements, in both the U.S. (Fields et al., 2012; Francis et al., 2012) and non-U.S. markets (Ge et al., 2012; Lin et al., 2014). Furthermore, industry surveys of institutional stakeholders including banks, conducted by McKinsey in 1999, revealed that board practices and board composition in a firm matter significantly in banks' credit and investment evaluations (Coombes and Watson, 2000). Therefore, if lenders view co-opted boards as less effective monitors, they are likely to impose a tighter set of covenants upon borrowing firms whose boards are more co-opted. Subsequently, if co-opted boards are indeed less effective monitors, these borrowers may also have a higher incidence of covenant violation following loan origination.\\nTo perform our analysis, we gather loan contract data from the Reuters Loan Pricing Corporation's DealScan database. We then merge the information with corporate borrower characteristics in the Compustat database. Data on board co-option are collected from Lalitha Naveen's website (Coles et al., 2014). CEO data are from the ExecuComp database. All other board variables are constructed using data obtained from the Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) director and governance databases. The final sample used for the baseline regression consists of 6114 loan facilities originated between 1998 and 2014.\\nOur findings support the theoretical prediction that more co-opted boards are associated with weaker board monitoring. Borrowing firms with a higher fraction of co-opted directors on the board were subject to more stringent covenants in their loan contracts. A one-standard-deviation increase from the mean in board co-option (from 46% to 78%) is found to increase the number of covenant categories included in a loan contract by about 24.5%, for example, from 4 to 5 types of covenants. A closer investigation of director types reveals that, when the board comprises more co-opted directors (independent or non-independent), lenders view this as an indicator of weaker internal monitoring and impose more loan covenants. In contrast, the presence of more non-co-opted independent directors on the board is found to reduce covenant intensity because they are seen by lenders as more effective monitors.\\nThese results are robust after accounting for potential endogeneity issues through a variety of techniques. Our first approach is subsample analysis, where we conduct a robustness test with a subset of loans whose firms' co-option level has not changed over two consecutive years. This is to address possible reverse causality from loan-level covenant intensity to firm-level co-option. In the second approach, we examine the effect of a regulatory shock in 2002 on the level of co-option and covenant intensity of the affected firms. In the third approach, we identify voluntary CEO turnovers as another channel of exogenous shock to examine the effect of co-option. The results from all these tests confirm that our findings are robust and unlikely to be driven by endogeneity bias. The effect of co-option on ex ante covenant strictness is also not driven by alternative explanations such as CEO tenure, director inexperience, or the “involved CEO” effect as argued by Shivdasani and Yermack (1999).\\nEx post examination of covenant violation provides evidence supporting the creditor's ex ante view. Firms with more co-opted boards are found more likely to violate loan covenants following loan origination. The result is robust after controlling for covenant intensity and covenant slack within each loan contract, and is not driven by the relaxation of covenant enforcement following the rise of covenant-light (cov-lite) loan contracts as highlighted by Becker and Ivashina (2017). We also document that non-co-opted independent directors could help reduce the incidence of covenant violation, but only among revolving loans and loans to unrated borrowers where benefits of effective monitoring are most pronounced.\\nThe contributions of this study are two-fold. First, it explores the relationship between co-opted boards and covenants in the private debt market. While prior work on board composition has mostly focused on the impact on firm performance, the impact of board co-option on non-price loan terms remains relatively unexplored. Coles et al. (2014) was the first to provide evidence suggesting a negative relationship between co-opted boards and monitoring effectiveness. Subsequent related studies reported that co-opted directors substitute for strong CEO power (Withisuphakorn and Jiraporn, 2017), co-opted boards have a lower probability of adopting clawback provisions (Huang et al., 2019), and board co-option has a negative impact on dividend policy (Jiraporn and Lee, 2018). Our study expands on this literature by suggesting that the influence of co-opted boards can be extended to the bank loan market.\\nSecond, this study adds to the growing literature on covenants by focusing on the composition and type of directors on the board as a factor that influences the need for covenants. Especially for covenant violations, past studies have mostly focused on their effect on firm performance brought about by a temporary shift in the control rights of the firm (Chava and Roberts, 2008; Nini et al., 2012; Roberts and Sufi, 2009a). This leaves factors affecting covenant intensity and the occurrence of covenant violation open for research exploration. Since co-opted directors have a direct impact on the board's overall monitoring effectiveness, and the use of covenants is linked to the need for monitoring, it is important to understand their relationship. Through the board monitoring channel, this study provides a more comprehensive analysis of covenant intensity at loan origination, and the incidence of covenant violations after the loan is made.\\nOur research backdrop is closest to Fields et al. (2012), who explored the effect of board quality on price and non-price loan terms. Although this study is similar in spirit to Fields et al. (2012), there are several major differences. First, Fields et al. (2012) examined the effect of board quality on covenant intensity using numerous different general proxies, except board co-option. While we do have the general proxies as controls, our study focuses on the role of co-opted directors and their impact on monitoring quality. Importantly, our result indicates that when co-option is included in the regression, most of the explanatory power is within co-option and the other variables become insignificant. Second, Fields et al. (2012) did not address potential endogeneity in the relationship between board quality and covenant intensity. We conduct extensive tests to address endogeneity in this study. Third, Fields et al. (2012) analyzed the impact of board quality on the ex ante likelihood that loans contain covenant requirements, but did not explore ex post covenant violations. Our study tests for subsequent covenant violations while controlling for covenant intensity. Finally, our analysis utilizes a much more comprehensive data set. Fields et al. (2012)’s sample for the covenant intensity regression included 700 loan facilities between 2002 and 2004, while our sample spans 1998–2014 with 6114 facilities in the baseline regression.\\nThe remainder of this study is organized as follows. The next section provides a literature review on the monitoring role of board directors, and on the potential influence of co-opted boards with regards to covenant intensity and violation. Section 3 outlines the data and sample construction. 4 Co-opted boards and covenant intensity, 5 Endogeneity, 6 Independent directors and covenant intensity, 7 Alternative explanations, 8 Co-opted boards and covenant violations present the empirical results. Section 9 concludes the study.\\n2. Literature review and hypothesis development\\n2.1. Board monitoring\\nAs an essential accessory to the corporate hierarchy of public firms, the board of directors takes on important responsibilities of advising on strategic issues and monitoring management performance (Fama and Jensen, 1983; Mace, 1971). Existing studies are supportive of the notion that the level of board monitoring is underpinned by the effectiveness of its independent members (Adams and Ferreira, 2007; Adams et al., 2010; Bhagat and Black, 2002; Dyck and Zingales, 2004; Faleye et al., 2011; Hermalin and Weisbach, 2003). An independent or outside director is one who is not employed by or affiliated with the firm (Brickley et al., 1994; Byrd and Hickman, 1992; Coles et al., 2014; Weisbach, 1988). Seminal papers, such as Fama (1980) and Fama and Jensen (1983), argued that independent directors are better monitors of the firm because they have a stronger incentive to maintain their reputation in the market. Furthermore, the appointment of more independent directors on the corporate board may reduce the severity of agency conflicts. In other words, firms with more independent boards are better monitored.\\nHowever, the empirical evidence on this connection is not consistent (Adams et al., 2010; Coles et al., 2008a; Coles et al., 2008b; Wintoki et al., 2012). Duchin et al. (2010) reported that the effectiveness of outside directors depends on the cost of acquiring information about the firm. Specifically, when the cost of acquiring information is low (high), performance increases (worsens) when outsiders are added to the board. Faleye (2015) noted that fully independent boards where the CEO is the only employee director are associated with a significant reduction in firm performance. In a recent paper, Cavaco et al. (2017) showed that board independence has an ambiguous impact on corporate performance because of opposing forces relating to the director nomination process and board functioning.\\nThese mixed findings raise questions about the reliability and robustness of board independence as a proxy for internal monitoring. It is possible that there are neglected aspects of monitoring not adequately captured by board independence. To better estimate the monitoring effectiveness of corporate boards, this study follows Coles et al. (2014) and focuses on the fraction of directors appointed after the CEO took office. These directors are referred to as co-opted directors. They are likely to decrease their monitoring in favour of their allegiance to the CEO who appointed them. Boards with a higher proportion of co-opted directors are expected to be less effective (i.e. weaker) monitors.\\n2.2. Co-opted boards and covenant intensity\\nCovenants have an important role in mitigating information asymmetry and agency problems in debt contracting (Jensen and Meckling, 1976; Smith, 1993; Smith and Warner, 1979). As a common feature seen in loan contracts, covenants are clauses that require the borrower to take or refrain from various actions (Rajan and Winton, 1995). They are designed as a form of protection measure for lenders against a borrower's morally hazardous behavior and used by lenders to monitor the borrower throughout the loan term (Aghion and Bolton, 1992; Chava and Roberts, 2008; Dewatripont and Tirole, 1994). Chava and Roberts (2008) and Nini et al. (2009) empirically documented that covenants mitigate borrower moral hazard problems by influencing the firm's operations outside of default.\\nThis implies that factors influencing lenders' need for monitoring are likely to also affect covenant intensity. From the lenders' perspective, firms with more effective board monitoring are less likely to develop serious moral hazards. Since the level of board co-option is expected to reduce board monitoring quality, there might be a greater need for lenders to impose tighter covenants on these firms. This study hypothesizes a positive relationship between co-opted boards and covenant intensity.\\nHypothesis 1\\n(H1): Loans made to firms with a higher (lower) proportion of co-opted directors on the board carry tighter (looser) covenants, ceteris paribus.\\n2.3. Co-opted boards and covenant violations\\nOver the course of the loan, lenders' assessment of borrowers' moral hazard risk using covenants is corroborated through the incidence of violations. Covenant violations are technical defaults that grant lenders with temporary control rights over the borrower (Gârleanu and Zwiebel, 2009; Roberts and Sufi, 2009a; Smith, 1993; Smith and Warner, 1979). They provide a platform for lenders to ascertain if they have accurately factored in and limited potential moral hazard problems in firms. If firms are indeed not moral hazards, then it is unlikely that they will violate covenants throughout the loan term. On the contrary, firms that do violate covenants are not only indicative of their moral hazard issues but they also require greater monitoring from lenders. This translates into additional costs for firms when they renegotiate their loan contract (Nini et al., 2009; Roberts and Sufi, 2009b) or take out subsequent loans (Freudenberg et al., 2017). This implies that although setting tighter covenants can provide lenders with the opportunity of early intervention, the ineffectiveness of co-opted boards in providing quality monitoring still results in a higher probability of firms becoming moral hazards. In other words, these firms are still more likely to engage in ex post opportunism, which leads to the following hypothesis.\\nHypothesis 2\\n(H2): The likelihood of covenant violation is higher (lower) for loans made to firms with a higher (lower) proportion of co-opted directors on the board, ceteris paribus.\\n3. Data and sample selection\\nThe sample is constructed using loan data from the Reuters Loan Pricing Corporation's DealScan database. Each observation in our sample represents a newly originated loan facility. It can refer to a bilateral loan or a tranche of a syndicated loan. The standard filters are applied to the initial DealScan data: 1) facilities are denominated in U.S. dollars; 2) London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) is the base rate; 3) All in Spread Drawn and facility amount are non-zero, and not missing; and 4) facilities made to firms in financial services and regulated industries are excluded.1\\nData on board co-option are available on Lalitha Naveen's website (Coles et al., 2014).2 CEO data are from the ExecuComp database. All other board variables are constructed using data obtained from the Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) director and governance databases.3 Quarterly data on firm financials are downloaded from the Compustat database. As posited by Coles et al. (2014), the data merging process between ISS and Compustat is complicated by the lack of a unique firm identifier or unique director identifier across all the years. This study uses the link data also provided on Lalitha Naveen's website to merge the ISS dataset with Compustat. The DealScan-Compustat Linking Database is used to merge Compustat data into the sample (Chava and Roberts, 2008).4 Covenant violation dummies are constructed using loan amendment information from DealScan's Facility Amendment dataset. The final sample used for the baseline regression consists of 6114 loan facilities originated between 1998 and 2014.5\\n3.1. Co-opted board measures\\nTo capture the effect of board co-option, four proxies are used interchangeably in the regressions: CO_OPTION, TW_CO_OPTION, RESIDUAL_CO_OPTION, and RESIDUAL_TW_CO_OPTION. Following Coles et al. (2014), the principal variable of interest is CO_OPTION. It is a continuous variable calculated as the number of co-opted directors divided by the total number of directors on the board, where a co-opted director is one elected after the CEO takes office. CO_OPTION takes values ranging from zero to one. Higher values indicate a greater degree of co-option or a more co-opted board (i.e., the board has relatively more co-opted directors).\\nAs an alternative measure of co-option, TW_CO_OPTION is the Tenure-Weighted Co-option variable. It is the sum of the tenure of co-opted directors divided by the total tenure of all directors. According to Coles et al. (2014), TW_CO_OPTION factors in the increasing influence of co-opted directors on board decisions over time. It is expected that as the tenure of co-opted directors increases, their influence on board decisions also increases. TW_CO_OPTION also ranges from zero to one. A higher value suggests a stronger influence of co-opted directors on the board.\\nThe remaining two measures of co-opted boards address the concern that a positive correlation exists between CEO tenure and co-option. To isolate this effect, CO_OPTION and TW_CO_OPTION are regressed separately on CEO tenure and the residuals are used in lieu of the original proxy. CEO tenure is the tenure of the firm's CEO, measured by the difference between the fiscal year end date and the date of becoming CEO. RESIDUAL_CO_OPTION is the residual(s) obtained by regressing CO_OPTION on CEO tenure. RESIDUAL_TW_CO_OPTION is the residual(s) from a regression of TW_CO_OPTION on CEO tenure. Similar to CO_OPTION, higher values in both measures are indicative of more co-opted boards.\\n3.2. Control variables\\nThe list of board, borrower, and loan characteristics included as control variables in the regressions is compiled from the existing literature on board quality and loan contracting (Bharath et al., 2011; Coles et al., 2014; Freudenberg et al., 2017). The board variables include board independence (BOARD_ INDEPENDENCE), board size (BOARD_SIZE), CEO tenure (CEO_TENURE), proportion of female directors on board (FEMALE_DIRECTOR), and whether CEO is also board chairman (CEO_DUALITY). Board data, including co-option level, is based on the year prior to loan origination.\\nBorrower characteristics include firm size (LOG_TA), leverage ratio (LEVERAGE), current ratio (CURRENT), tangibility ratio (TANGIBILITY), market to book ratio (MB_RATIO), profitability ratio (PROFITABILITY), and coverage ratio (LOG_COVERAGE). Borrower data is measured as the average of the quarterly data over the four calendar quarters prior to loan origination. Loan characteristics include maturity (LOG_MATURITY), facility amount (LOG_FACILITYAMT), loan type (REVOLVER), and performance pricing (PERFORMANCE_PRICING).\\nOther control variables include SP500 dummy, GFC dummy, rating dummies, industry controls, and loan purpose controls. The SP500 dummy identifies if the loan is made to a borrower listed in the Standard & Poor's (S&P) 500 index, while the GFC dummy distinguishes whether the loan is originated before or after the Global Financial Crisis (GFC). Rating dummies are based on the firm's S&P long-term issuer rating. They capture investment grade firms (BBB- or better) and those without ratings (firms not rated by S&P). Industry controls are based on the Global Industry Classification Standards (GICS). Loan purpose controls include takeovers, acquisitions, leveraged buyouts, working capital, corporate purposes, debt repayment, and all other purposes in the sample. For the covenant violation models, collateral requirement (COLLATERAL) and covenant strictness (PVIOL) are included as additional control variables. This would address the concern that firms' likelihood of violating covenants is subject to covenant restrictiveness. The definitions of all variables can be found in Appendix 1.\\n3.3. Descriptive statistics\\nTable 1 presents the summary statistics for the loan sample. Panel A reports the board-related variables. The average board has about 9.55 directors (BOARD_SIZE), with approximately 46% being co-opted directors (CO_OPTION). Consistent with Coles et al. (2014), this suggests that close to half of the board are co-opted by the CEO. This percentage can be further split into independent and non-independent directors. 34% of the board is made up of co-opted directors who are also independent (CO_OPTED_INDEPENDENCE). Directors who are co-opted but not independent form 11% of the board (CO_OPTED_NON_INDEPENDENCE). Independent directors represent 69% of the board (BOARD_INDEPENDENCE), 36% of which are non-co-opted directors who were already on the board when the CEO assumed office (NON_CO_OPTED_INDEPENDENCE).\\nTable 1.

The number of observations, mean, standard deviation, minimum, median, and maximum are reported for all variables in Panels A to C. Panel A covers the board-related variables, Panel B shows the firm financials and other characteristics, and Panel C reports the loan characteristics. Board data is based on the year prior to loan origination. Borrowing firm data is measured as the average of the quarterly data over the four calendar quarters prior to loan origination. The definitions of all variables are provided in Appendix 1. All variables are winsorized at the 1% and 99% levels.\\nThe CEO maintains an average tenure of around 7.41 years (CEO_TENURE). Across boards, the typical director has an average tenure of around 8.39 years (AVR_DIRECTORTENURE). 14% of the firms have a nominating committee where the CEO is part of the committee (INVOLVED_CEO), and 17% of the firms have a CEO who is also board chairman (CEO_DUALITY). On average, 10% of the board members are female (FEMALE_DIRECTOR). There are fewer observations for the board-related variables because of data unavailability. In addition, not all firms with available board data in a given calendar year obtained funding in the loan market.\\nThe borrower characteristics are presented in Panel B of Table 1. The average firm has an asset size (TA) of $4695.90 million, a leverage ratio (LEVERAGE) of 0.31, and a current ratio (CURRENT) of 1.92. The average firm also has a tangibility ratio (TANGIBILITY) of 0.31 and a market-to-book ratio (MB_RATIO) of 1.71. The mean profitability ratio (PROFITABILITY) and coverage ratio (COVERAGE) are found to be 0.17 and 29.14, respectively. Loans made to investment grade firms (IG) form 20% of the sample, a further 35% belong to non-investment grade firms, and the remaining 45% are loans to firms without credit ratings (NOT_RATED). 17% of the loans in the sample are made to borrowers listed in the S&P 500 index (SP500).\\nThe summary statistics for loan characteristics are shown in Panel C of Table 1. According to Bradley and Roberts (2015)’s covenant intensity measure, an average loan has 2 out of 6 possible covenant categories (CI_INDEX).6 Using a simple count of all individual covenants, a loan contract includes about 5.51 covenants (TOT_COV). On average, about 12% of the loans report a covenant violation within 1 year of loan origination (FIRSTYEAR_VIO). The average loan facility (FACILITYAMT) amounts to $375 million with a maturity (MATURITY) of around 50 months. Loans that require collateral make up 47% of the sample (COLLATERAL). On average, 68% of the facilities are revolving loans (REVOLVER) and 49% contain a performance pricing grid (PERFORMANCE_PRICING).\\n4. Co-opted boards and covenant intensity\\n4.1. Baseline results\\nAs a common feature of loan contracts, covenants are monitoring devices (Chava and Roberts, 2008; Jensen and Meckling, 1976; Smith and Warner, 1979). Depending on the need for monitoring, lenders set covenant thresholds that best compass that need. These covenants impose varying restrictions on borrowers' financial flexibility throughout the loan term (Nini et al., 2012). Firms who are deemed by lenders to require more (less) intensive monitoring are likely to be subject to more (less) covenants. Since the quality of internal monitoring is expected to be lower when the board has more co-opted directors, there might be a greater need for lenders to impose tighter covenants on these firms. The pooled cross-sectional regression model used to test the relationship between co-opted boards and covenant intensity (as hypothesized in H1) is set out below in Eq. (1):\\n(1)\\nwhere CI_INDEXt is the proxy for covenant intensity on a loan facility a firm borrows in year t, and CO_OPTIONt−1 is the fraction of board directors being co-opted in year t-1. All borrower characteristics, loan characteristics and other controls are defined in Appendix 1.\\nThis study uses the covenant index (CI_INDEX) suggested by Bradley and Roberts (2015) as the proxy for covenant intensity. It is an index variable capturing the degree to which creditors impose restrictions on the actions of the borrower's management. A higher covenant index implies greater restrictions on the borrower's management. The index is created as sum of the following six covenant indicators/categories: (1) collateral, (2) dividend restriction, (3) presence of more than two financial covenants, (4) asset sales sweep, (5) equity issuance sweep, and (6) debt issuance sweep; and so it ranges between 0 and 6. Given its ordinal nature, Eq. (1) is estimated via a Poisson regression, where CI_INDEX is the dependent variable. This study expects positive and statistically significant coefficient estimates across all four proxies of board co-option. As the board becomes more co-opted, borrowing firms are expected to face tighter covenants.\\nTable 2 shows the regression results for this effect. Four proxies of board co-option are used. Column 1 reports the effect of the main proxy of co-option on covenant intensity. As expected, a positive and statistically significant coefficient estimate at the 1% level is observed for CO_OPTION (=0.219, z-statistic = 3.00). This suggests that covenant intensity increases with board co-option. To measure the economic significance of this coefficient, we estimate the effect of a one-standard-deviation increase in board co-option on the covenant index (CI_INDEX). Recall our model is estimated using Poisson regression because the dependent variable CI_INDEX is a count variable ranging between 0 and 6. The Poission regression estimates the natural log of the dependent variable as a function of explanatory variables. As such, a one-standard-deviation increase from the mean in board co-option (from 46% to 78%) is associated with an increase of 0.219 in natural log of covenant index. This is in turn equivalent to a 24.5% increase in the covenant index, for example, from 4 to 5 covenant categories.\\nTable 2.

The different measures of co-opted boards are: (1) CO_OPTION, (2) TW_CO_OPTION, (3) RESIDUAL_CO_OPTION, and (4) RESIDUAL_TW_CO_OPTION. SP500/GFC dummies, rating dummies, industry controls, and loan purpose controls are included in all regressions, but their coefficients are not reported. Rating dummies measure the firm's S&P long-term issuer rating. They capture investment grade firms (BBB- or better), and firms not rated by S&P. Industry controls are based on GICS. Loan purpose controls cover takeovers, acquisitions, leveraged buyouts, working capital, corporate purposes, debt repayment, and all other purposes in the sample. Board data is based on the year prior to loan origination. Borrower data is measured as the average of the quarterly data over the four calendar quarters prior to loan origination. The definitions of all variables are provided in Appendix 1. Standard errors (in parentheses) are robust to heteroscedasticity and clustered at the firm level. The number of observations and Pseudo- R2 are also reported at the bottom of the table. The statistical significance of results is indicated by ⁎ = 10% level, ⁎⁎ = 5% level, and ⁎⁎⁎ = 1% level.\\nFields et al. (2012) also estimated a similar regression with several key differences. Their covenant index has 3 categories while our index comprises 6 important covenant categories. Our main variable of interest, co-option, is not among their explanatory variables, and their sample size is about 11% of our sample size. As a result, there are several differences in the empirical findings. They reported both board size and board independence are significant at the 10% level and percentage of female directors significant at the 1% level. Our result shows that both percentage of female directors and board size become insignificant when co-option is included in the regression. Board independence becomes weakly significant at the 10% level.7\\nThe coefficient estimates of the control variables in Column 1 of Table 2 are consistent with theoretical expectations. Larger firms tend to be of lower credit risk and therefore are subject to fewer covenants. Covenant intensity is negatively related to firms' current ratio, market-to-book ratio, and interest coverage. As the loan maturity and loan size increase, so does covenant intensity. Revolving loans are found to carry significantly fewer covenants. This may reflect the fact that revolving loans are often monitored much more closely, which in turn lessens the need for imposing more restrictive covenants.8 We also observe that loans with performance pricing contain more covenant restrictions on the borrowing firm.\\nColumn 2 of Table 2 reports the regression output of Eq. (1) using the tenure-weighted alternative of board co-option (TW_CO_OPTION). It takes into account the positive relationship between the tenure of co-opted directors and their ability to influence board decisions. The coefficient estimate of TW_CO_OPTION is positive and statistically significant at the 5% level. This is in line with expectation.\\nFollowing Coles et al. (2014), this study also uses RESIDUAL_CO_OPTION and RESIDUAL_TW_CO_OPTION as alternative co-opted board measures. These are residuals from regressing CO_OPTION and TW_CO_OPTION on CEO tenure, respectively. These two proxies should mitigate any bias arising from the positive relationship between CEO tenure and co-option. The results using these two variables are shown in Columns 3 and 4, respectively. The coefficient estimates of both measures continue to exhibit positive and statistically significant relationships with covenant intensity.\\nIt could also be argued that CO_OPTION is simply a proxy for CEO tenure. To ensure the robustness of our result, we re-estimate our baseline regression with CEO tenure in place of board co-option. Contrary to the finding for CO_OPTION seen in Columns 1–2 of Table 2, CEO tenure appears to have no effect on covenant intensity when co-option is absent (untabulated results). This implies that the positive relationship found between CO_OPTION and covenant intensity is not driven by CEO tenure.\\nThe findings from Table 2 provide strong evidence to suggest that lenders associate co-opted boards with weaker monitoring. As a result, firms with a higher proportion of co-opted directors on their boards face tighter loan covenants.\\n4.2. Robustness checks\\nTo ensure robustness of our previous results, we first re-estimate Eq. (1) with firm fixed effects. Second, it is possible that many loan facilities belong to the same loan deal originated on date X, between bank A and borrowing firm B, which leads to serial dependence among these facilities. We follow the approach commonly adopted in the literature (Allen and Paligorova, 2015; Chin et al., 2018; Dezső and Ross, 2012; Kuncl, 2019), and re-estimate our facility-level regressions with standard errors clustered at the deal level instead of firm level. Third, we utilize an alternative measure of covenant intensity. Instead of Bradley and Roberts (2015)’s CI_INDEX which covers six main covenant categories, we use a simple count of the total number of covenants (TOT_COV). These results are presented in Columns 1–3 of Table 3, and reinforce the positive relationship between board co-option and covenant intensity with significance levels between 1% and 10%.\\nTable 3.

In Column 1, the measure of covenant intensity is the Covenant Intensity Index (CI_INDEX) and the regression includes borrower (firm) fixed effects. In Column 2, the measure of covenant intensity is the Covenant Intensity Index (CI_INDEX) and the regression standard errors are clustered at the loan deal level instead of firm level. In Column 3, the measure of covenant intensity is total covenant count (TOT_COV). SP500/GFC dummies, rating dummies, industry controls, and loan purpose controls are included in all regressions, but their coefficients are not reported. Rating dummies measure the firm's S&P long-term issuer rating. They capture investment grade firms (BBB- or better), and firms not rated by S&P. Industry controls are based on GICS. Loan purpose controls cover takeovers, acquisitions, leveraged buyouts, working capital, corporate purposes, debt repayment, and all other purposes in the sample. Board data is based on the year prior to loan origination. Borrower data is measured as the average of the quarterly data over the four calendar quarters prior to loan origination. The definitions of all variables are provided in Appendix 1. Standard errors (in parentheses) are robust to heteroscedasticity and clustered at the firm level (Columns 1 and 3) and deal level (Column 2). The number of observations and Pseudo-R2 are also reported at the bottom of the table. The statistical significance of results is indicated by ⁎ = 10% level, ⁎⁎ = 5% level, and ⁎⁎⁎ = 1% level.\\n5. Endogeneity\\nThe issue of endogeneity is often unavoidable in banking and corporate governance research. In examining the impact of board co-option on loan covenant intensity, we are faced with potential endogeneity issues emerging under two channels. One, there may be reverse causality (i.e. simultaneity) in the sense that firms' anticipation of how tight and restrictive their future loan covenants may become, can change their current behavior and the extent to which a board is structured with more or less co-opted directors. Two, the omitted variable bias is likely to be present, due to unobserved factors affecting both board co-option and loan contract terms, hence results in a spurious association being observed between them. We address this concern through several approaches – accounting for reverse causality, employing difference-in-differences (DiD) analysis, and identifying voluntary CEO turnovers.9\\n5.1. Reverse causality\\nOur first approach is to identify a group of loans where the percentage of co-opted directors on the board has remained unchanged for two consecutive years. Jiraporn and Lee (2018) argued that when a firm's level of board co-option remains relatively consistent over time, it is unlikely to have a reverse effect of covenant intensity on board co-option; hence endogeneity is less of a concern for this group of loans. The identified group of loans represents about 39% of our total sample. We re-estimate Eq. (1) using this sub-sample and the results are presented in Table 4. It shows that covenant intensity remains positively related to co-option. The overall results are qualitatively similar to those reported in Table 2. The coefficients of all four co-option proxies are positive and significant at the 5–10% level. Hence, there is no evidence to suggest that our previous result is driven by board co-option and covenant intensity being determined simultaneously.\\nTable 4.

The different measures of co-opted boards are: (1) CO_OPTION, (2) TW_CO_OPTION, (3) RESIDUAL_CO_OPTION, and (4) RESIDUAL_TW_CO_OPTION. SP500/GFC dummies, rating dummies, industry controls, and loan purpose controls are included in all regressions, but their coefficients are not reported. Rating dummies measure the firm's S&P long-term issuer rating. They capture investment grade firms (BBB- or better), and firms not rated by S&P. Industry controls are based on GICS. Loan purpose controls cover takeovers, acquisitions, leveraged buyouts, working capital, corporate purposes, debt repayment, and all other purposes in the sample. Board data is based on the year prior to loan origination. Borrower data is measured as the average of the quarterly data over the four calendar quarters prior to loan origination. The definitions of all variables are provided in Appendix 1. Standard errors (in parentheses) are robust to heteroscedasticity and clustered at the firm level. The number of observations and Pseudo-R2 are also reported at the bottom of the table. The statistical significance of results is indicated by ⁎ = 10% level, ⁎⁎ = 5% level, and ⁎⁎⁎ = 1% level.\\n5.2. Difference-in-Differences (DiD) regression\\nOur second approach utilizes the change in regulations by NASDAQ and NYSE in 2002 (in conjunction with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or SOX), which requires firms to have a majority of independent directors (more than 50%) on the board.10 Leading up to 2002, non-compliant firms were required to increase the number of independent directors on their board to meet the new regulation. Hence, these firms had to hire new independent directors to add to the board, which resulted in an exogenous shock in the level of co-option for non-compliant firms. We utilize this exogenous shock which affects co-option but should not be correlated with covenant intensity, to re-examine the relation between these variables. We identify non-compliant firms (treated group) as those that did not meet the majority board independence rule in 2001, and the remaining ones are compliant firms (control group). The following DiD model (Eq. (2)) is estimated:\\n(2)\\nwhere CI_INDEXt is the proxy for covenant intensity on a loan facility a firm borrows in year t; Non_Compliant equals 1 for firms that did not meet the majority board independence rule in 2001 and zero otherwise; PostSOX equals 1 (0) for loans originated after (before) the 2002 regulatory change. All borrower characteristics, loan characteristics and other controls are defined in Appendix 1.\\nColumn 1 of Table 5 (Panel A) presents the result for the DiD analysis, where the key variable of interest is the interaction term between PostSOX and Non_Compliant. Its coefficient is indeed positive (0.217) and significant at 10%, indicating that on average, following the 2002 regulatory change and associated upward shock to board co-option levels, a non-compliant firm receives loans with more covenant restrictions compared to a compliant firm.\\nTable 5.

The dummy variable PostSOX takes the value of 1 if the loan is originated after the 2002 mandatory increase in independent directors implemented by NASDAQ and NYSE, and zero otherwise. The dummy variable Non_Compliant equals 1 for loans made to non-compliant borrowers (those that did not meet the majority board independence rule in 2001) (treated group), and zero otherwise. In Column 1, the regression is estimated on the full sample of loans. In Column 2, the falsification test is conducted by estimating the DiD equation on loans originated during 1998–2001 and the pseudo-event is assumed to occur in 1999, where the dummy variable Post1999 equals 1 for loans issued after 1999 and zero otherwise. In Column 3, the DiD regression is estimated on an entropy balanced sample, where the three moments of the covariates are matched between compliant and non-compliant firms. SP500/GFC dummies, rating dummies, industry controls, and loan purpose controls are included in all regressions, but their coefficients are not reported. Rating dummies measure the firm's S&P long-term issuer rating. They capture investment grade firms (BBB- or better), and firms not rated by S&P. Industry controls are based on GICS. Loan purpose controls cover takeovers, acquisitions, leveraged buyouts, working capital, corporate purposes, debt repayment, and all other purposes in the sample. Board data is based on the year prior to loan origination. Borrower data is measured as the average of the quarterly data over the four calendar quarters prior to loan origination. The definitions of all variables are provided in Appendix 1. Standard errors (in parentheses) are robust to heteroscedasticity and clustered at the firm level. The number of observations and Pseudo-R2 are also reported at the bottom of the table. The statistical significance of results is indicated by ⁎ = 10% level, ⁎⁎ = 5% level, and ⁎⁎⁎ = 1% level.\\nWe also investigate the parallel trend assumption to ensure that these two groups, compliant and non-compliant firms, were not already diverging prior to SOX. In other words, the DiD framework is based on the assumption that both the control and treatment groups have similar trends in the outcome variable in the pre-treatment period (Lemmon and Roberts, 2010; Roberts and Whited, 2012). While the parallel trend assumption is not directly testable, we ameliorate concerns that this assumption may be violated via three approaches. First, we graph the yearly average covenant index for the two groups of firms across the sample period (Fig. 1). It appears that the divergence started in 2002 following the introduction of SOX. From 2002 to 2003, the covenant index increased for non-compliant firms but decreased marginally for compliant firms. Over a longer 5-year interval following SOX, the covenant index for compliant firms appears to be quite flat with no obvious trend. For the non-compliant group, covenant index increased following SOX then slowly decreased over the subsequent 5 years. Both groups displayed a sharp decrease in covenant index after the GFC. Overall, it appears that the two groups did not divert prior to the introduction of SOX.\\nDownload : Download high-res image (129KB)Download : Download full-size image\\nFig. 1. Yearly average covenant index for loans to compliant and non-compliant firms (1998–2014).\\nThis figure depicts the yearly mean covenant index on loan contracts issued to compliant firms and those to non-compliant firms between 1998 and 2014. Compliant and non-compliant firms are identified based on whether the firm met the majority board independence rule in 2001.\\nSecond, we further address the possibility of unparallel trends between two groups of firms by adopting a falsification test suggested by Roberts and Whited (2012). To ensure the falsification test results are not driven by the actual regulatory change in 2002, we re-estimate the DiD model (Eq. (2)) on a subsample of loans originated during 1998–2001, and assume the pseudo-event occurs in 1999. The dummy variable Post1999 equals 1 for loans issued after 1999 and zero otherwise. As shown in Column 2 of Table 5, the coefficient of Post1999*Non_Compliant is statistically insignificant. This suggests that differences in covenant intensity in loan contracts made to compliant and non-compliant firms are unlikely to be driven by the 1999 pseudo-event.\\nThird, we allow for the possibility that compliant and non-compliant firms may be fundamentally different in their risk and financial characteristics by adopting the entropy balancing method. Following Hainmueller (2012), we re-weight the covariates of compliant firms such that the moments (mean, variance, and skewness) are matched between two groups of firms. The regression output of Eq. (2) using the entropy balanced sample is presented in Column 3 of Table 5, which adds robustness to our results. The interaction term PostSOX*Non_Compliant remains positive and significant at the 10% level, with a coefficient magnitude (0.224) similar to that estimated for the unmatched sample in Column 1.\\n5.3. Exogenous shock via CEO turnovers\\nIn addition to using SOX as an exogenous shock to address endogeneity, we examine another channel of shock to the level of board co-option, CEO departures/turnovers.11 CEO turnovers represent a special event when a firm's co-option resets to zero. In this setup, we limit our sample to loans issued within 12 months before and 12 months after their firm experienced a CEO turnover. We create a dummy variable POST_TURNOVER which equals 1 for loans initiated in the year after a CEO turnover, and zero otherwise. Given the level of co-option will drop following a CEO turnover, we predict these post-turnover loans will contain lower covenant intensity. The following regression (Eq. (3)) is estimated and POST_TURNOVER is predicted to load negatively on CI_INDEX.\\n(3)\\nwhere CI_INDEXt is the proxy for covenant intensity on a loan facility a firm borrows in year t; POST_TURNOVERt equals 1 (0) for loans initiated within 12 months after (before) a CEO turnover. All borrower characteristics, loan characteristics and other controls are defined in Appendix 1.\\nHowever, not all CEO turnovers are of the same nature. The CEO turnover literature broadly categorizes turnovers into two groups, forced and voluntary turnovers, based on vastly different underlying reasons. Forced turnovers are often associated with changes in firm fundamentals such as poor performance, major scandals or firm policy changes, as documented in both equity and debt markets (Adams and Mansi, 2009; Blackwell et al., 2007; Clayton et al., 2005; Pan et al., 2015). Throughout these events, firm fundamentals often experience significant shifts, which suggests that forced turnovers are not random shocks. In contrast, voluntary turnovers should be independent from any change in firm fundamentals and may serve as a “clean” exogenous shock to co-option level. We identify voluntary CEO turnovers from ExecuComp with the aid of Peters and Wagner (2014)’s dataset.12 We then replace POST_TURNOVER in Eq. (3) with another dummy variable, POST_VOLUNTARY, which equals 1 (0) for loans initiated within 12 months after (before) a voluntary CEO turnover.\\nThe regression output for Eq. (3) using POST_TURNOVER and POST_VOLUNTARY is presented in Columns 1 and 2 of Table 6, respectively. The results confirm our predicted negative effect of turnovers on covenant intensity, with both coefficients being significantly negative. The coefficient of POST_VOLUNTARY is stronger than that of POST_TURNOVER in both magnitude (−0.241 compared to −0.191) and significance level (1% compared to 5%). This suggests that exogenous voluntary CEO turnovers provide us with a “clean” setting, not confounded by contemporaneous changes in firm fundamentals and borrowing terms, to further strengthen our analyses.\\nTable 6.

Independent directors and covenant intensity\\nAn important implication from Coles et al. (2014) is that not all independent directors are equally effective monitors. They showed that co-opted independent directors behave in a similar way to non-independent directors, while non-co-opted independent directors are most effective monitors. We test if banks consider such board composition characteristics in setting their covenant restrictions. If they do, we should find a higher percentage of non-co-opted independent directors to be associated with looser covenant restrictions. At the same time, a higher percentage of co-opted directors (independent or non-independent) should lead to tighter covenant restrictions.\\nCo-option and independence are two board characteristics that are not mutually exclusive and may overlap with each other. For example, some of the directors included in the measure of Co-option may be independent directors, and vice versa, some directors counted in the Independence measure may be co-opted. Following Coles et al. (2014)’s classification, we are able to segregate directors into four mutually exclusive groups based on two dimensions, co-option and independence, hence estimate more accurately their individual as well as joint effects. We construct the following variables, “Co-opted Independence”, “Co-opted Non-Independence”, and “Non-Co-opted Independence”, and examine their impact on covenant intensity.\\nTable 7 reports the results of this analysis. Column 1 tests if independent directors are viewed as effective monitors by banks when they are also co-opted directors. The coefficient of CO_OPTED_INDEPENDENCE is positive and significant at the 1% level. In unreported tests, this study also repeats the analysis using the tenure-weighted equivalence of Co-opted Independence (TW_CO_OPTED_INDEPENDENCE), where a similar finding is observed. The finding in Column 2 of Table 7 suggests that Co-opted Non-Independence increases covenant intensity. The coefficient estimate of CO_OPTED_NON_INDEPENDENCE is positive and statistically significant at the 10% level.\\nTable 7.

SP500/GFC dummies, rating dummies, industry controls, and loan purpose controls are included in all regressions, but their coefficients are not reported.

The number of observations and Pseudo-R2 are also reported at the bottom of the table. The statistical significance of results is indicated by ⁎ = 10% level, ⁎⁎ = 5% level, and ⁎⁎⁎ = 1% level.\\nCollectively, the findings from Columns 1 and 2 of Table 7 suggest that creditors perceive co-opted directors as weaker monitors hence increase loan covenant intensity regardless of whether these directors are independent or non-independent. It appears that lenders view being co-opted as overriding independent directors' ability to monitor. It is possible that the perceived effective monitors may be the independent directors who are not co-opted. More importantly, Non-Co-opted Independence may be a more precise measure of board monitoring effectiveness compared to the conventional board independence measure. Even if board independence is observed to be fairly static over the years, there may be a shift in board composition brought about by the entry of co-opted directors.\\nThe evidence provided by Coles et al. (2014) showed that Co-opted Independence increases but Non-Co-opted Independence decreases with CEO tenure. This can be attributed to the replacement of previously appointed independent directors with new independent directors as the CEO becomes more established in their position. Hence, board independence is capturing both Co-opted Independence and Non-Co-opted Independence. To test this hypothesis, both Co-option and Board Independence are replaced with NON_CO_OPTED_INDEPENDENCE. Column 3 of Table 7 shows the result of this analysis. The finding indicates that lenders identify directors who are both non-co-opted and independent as more effective monitors, hence reduce loan covenant intensity. The coefficient on NON_CO_OPTED_INDEPENDENCE is significantly negative at the 1% level. Consistent with Coles et al. (2014), this finding suggests that Non-Co-opted Independence may be a more refined measure of monitoring effectiveness compared to board independence.\\n7. Alternative explanations\\nOne of the most immediate concerns with co-option is that it could be a proxy for CEO power which tends to increase with CEO tenure. Section 4.1 addressed the possibility that CEO tenure may be driving the effect of co-option on covenant intensity in three ways. First, we included CEO tenure as a control variable in the baseline regression where the coefficient of CO_OPTION remains significant (Column 1 of Table 2). Second, we replaced CO_OPTION with CEO tenure to proxy for CEO power, where the estimated coefficient of CEO_TENURE is statistically insignificant (untabulated results). Third, we estimated two additional proxies (RESIDUAL_ CO_OPTION and RESIDUAL_TW_CO_OPTION) by obtaining the residuals from a regression of CO_OPTION and TW_CO_OPTION on CEO tenure, and the results remained robust (Columns 3–4 of Table 2).\\nThe other possible alternative explanations relate to director inexperience and the “involved CEO” argument. Coles et al. (2014) posited that higher co-option could simply relate to more new directors that are less experienced on the board. These directors may appear to be supportive of the CEO not because of allegiance, but because they are new to the board and are less responsive to poor performance. Furthermore, co-option could also capture the “involved CEO” effect proposed by Shivdasani and Yermack (1999). A CEO is considered “involved” when they sit on the nominating committee to appoint new directors, or when the firm does not have a nominating committee. Shivdasani and Yermack (1999) showed that involved CEOs are more likely to appoint gray outside directors. The net effect is that involved CEOs have more power over the board, which may render board monitoring less effective. We conduct three additional tests to rule out these two possibilities.\\nFirst, we include average director tenure as proxy for director experience, where average director tenure (AVR_DIRECTORTENURE) is the average tenure of all directors on the board, and an “Involved CEO” dummy in the baseline regression. The result for co-option remains strongly significant. Second, we replace co-option in the baseline regression with AVR_DIRECTORTENURE and “Involved CEO” as regressors. We find these two variables have no significant effect on loan covenant intensity.13 Third, we construct two new measures: DIRECTOR_TENURE_ADJ_CO_OPTION and INVOLVED_CEO_ADJ_CO_OPTION to isolate the effect of co-option. DIRECTOR_TENURE_ADJ_CO_OPTION is the residual(s) obtained by regressing CO_OPTION on average director tenure. Similarly, INVOLVED_CEO_ADJ_ CO_OPTION is the residual(s) obtained by regressing CO_OPTION on the “Involved CEO” dummy. We use each of these two proxies in place of CO_OPTION in the baseline regression model; the results are presented in Table 8.\\nTable 8.

In alternative specifications, CO_OPTION is replaced by the following explanatory variables: (1) DIRECTOR_TENURE_ADJ_CO_OPTION and (2) INVOLVED_CEO_ADJ_CO_OPTION.

Hence, there is no evidence to suggest that co-option is proxying for director inexperience or the “involved CEO” effect. Even after controlling for each of these factors, a positive association is observed between co-option and covenant intensity.\\n8. Co-opted boards and covenant violations\\nA violation of a covenant is considered an event of default. The borrower's failure to comply with the covenant gives the creditor the right to demand immediate repayment or accelerate the repayment of the entire loan balance. In practice, lenders rarely accelerate the loan repayment (Nini et al., 2012). Instead, covenant violations trigger a renegotiation process in which the right to accelerate assigns a high amount of bargaining power to the creditors. Chava and Roberts (2008) showed that capital investment declines sharply following a financial covenant violation when creditors use the threat of accelerating loan repayment to intervene in management. Nini et al. (2012) reported that violations are followed immediately by a decline in acquisitions and capital expenditures, a sharp reduction in leverage and shareholder payouts, and an increase in CEO turnover. At the same time, creditors may also wield the bargaining power gained in post-violation to influence loan contract terms to their benefit. Roberts and Sufi (2009a) found that net debt issuing activity experiences a sharp and persistent decline following debt covenant violations when creditors use their acceleration and termination rights to increase interest rates and reduce the availability of credit. In addition, Billett et al. (2016) found that violation firms face not only increased borrowing costs but also increased creditor involvement.\\nGiven such costs, a well-governed firm would avoid covenant violation through mechanisms such as monitoring by board directors. In the previous sections, we posited that co-opted directors could render board monitoring less effective. Banks share this view therefore increase covenant intensity when lending to firms with more co-opted boards. In this section, we examine the effect of co-option on covenant violations following loan issuance. Following Demerjian and Owens (2016), we calculate a variable labelled FIRSTYEAR_VIO which equals 1 if the loan facility has a covenant violation within the first year of issuance and zero otherwise. We argue that if co-opted directors are indeed less effective monitors, firms with a higher degree of board co-option would be more likely to violate covenants after controlling for covenant tightness. We estimate the following logit model (Eq. (4)) to examine the effect of board co-option on the likelihood of covenant violation within a year after loan origination (Hypothesis 2).\\n(4)\\nwhere FIRSTYEAR_VIOt equals 1 if the loan facility borrowed in year t has a covenant violation within the first year of issuance and zero otherwise; CO_OPTIONt−1 is the fraction of board directors being co-opted in year t-1; PVIOLt is the aggregate probability of covenant violation proposed by Demerjian and Owens (2016), which takes into account the number of covenants as well as the initial slack of each covenant in a loan contract. All borrower characteristics, loan characteristics and other controls are defined in Appendix 1.\\nThis study tests Hypothesis 2 at the loan level while controlling for not only number of covenant restrictions but also covenant slack. This is a critical control variable because the likelihood of a firm violating a covenant can be a direct function of how slack/restrictive that covenant is. We control for covenant slack and covenant intensity of each loan contract utilizing Demerjian and Owens (2016)’s proxy for probability of covenant violation. This proxy, labelled PVIOL, is an estimate for the aggregate probability of covenant violation for each facility in DealScan. PVIOL is estimated using simulation and considers both the number of covenants and initial slack of each covenant. PVIOL can also address the concern in relaxation of covenant enforcement brought about by the rise of “covenant-light” (cov-lite) issuance in the syndicated loan segment. As clarified in Becker and Ivashina (2017), these cov-lite contracts do not have fewer covenants; instead, they are differentiated from other loans by their weaker covenant enforcement. By controlling for PVIOL, we account for the direct link between covenant slack (or strictness) and violation, hence mitigate the possibility that impact of board co-option on covenant violations may be driven by the “cov-lite” phenomenon.\\nThe logit regression output for Eq. (4) is presented in Table 9. Columns 1–2 show the results for CO_OPTION and TW_CO_OPTION, while their residuals are used in Columns 3–4, respectively. All four co-opted board measures consistently exhibit positive relationships with covenant violations, statistically significant at the 5% level. Overall, the results suggest that a more co-opted board is evident of weaker monitoring and is less effective in steering the firm away from unfavorable opportunistic behavior. As a result, firms with a more co-opted board are found to face a higher incidence of covenant violations in the year following loan origination. Consistent with Demerjian and Owens (2016), PVIOL is strongly associated with the likelihood of covenant violation within the first year of loan origination. Our results remain robust when CI_INDEX is used as a regressor in place of PVIOL (untabulated results).\\nTable 9.

The different measures of co-opted boards are (1) CO_OPTION, (2) TW_CO_OPTION, (3) RESIDUAL_CO_OPTION, and (4) RESIDUAL_TW_CO_OPTION. FIRSTYEAR_VIO takes the value of 1 if the first covenant violation date falls within 1 year from the facility start date and zero otherwise. PVIOL is the aggregate probability of covenant violation proposed by Demerjian and Owens (2016), which considers both the number of covenants and initial slack of each covenant in a contract. SP500/GFC dummies, rating dummies, industry controls, and loan purpose controls are included in all regressions, but their coefficients are not reported. Rating dummies measure the firm's S&P long-term issuer rating. They capture investment grade firms (BBB- or better), and firms not rated by S&P. Industry controls are based on GICS. Loan purpose controls cover takeovers, acquisitions, leveraged buyouts, working capital, corporate purposes, debt repayment, and all other purposes in the sample. Board data is based on the year prior to loan origination. Borrower data is measured as the average of the quarterly data over the four calendar quarters prior to the year of the first covenant violation. The definitions of all variables are provided in Appendix 1. Standard errors (in parentheses) are robust to heteroscedasticity and clustered at the firm level. The number of observations and Pseudo-R2 are also reported at the bottom of the table. The statistical significance of results is indicated by ⁎ = 10% level, ⁎⁎ = 5% level, and ⁎⁎⁎ = 1% level.\\nSection 6 of this paper provided evidence that being co-opted overrides independent directors' monitoring effectiveness. The only group of directors that were perceived by creditors to be effective monitors are non-co-opted independent directors (NON_CO_OPTED_INDEPENDENCE). The result from Section 6 indicated that firms with a higher percentage of non-co-opted independent directors on the board are subject to fewer covenant restrictions. In the final set of analyses, we further examine if this group of directors can indeed help steer the firm away from ex post covenant violation by focusing on a subsample of borrowers and loans where board monitoring can add significant value. We use loan types and borrowers' credit rating availability to capture this channel. As documented in the extant literature, revolving loans are inherently very different from term loans as they require more intense monitoring due to their draw-down feature. Hence, we expect that the benefits from monitoring skills of non-co-opted independent directors could be stronger for revolving loans. Similarly, board monitoring should be more valuable to unrated borrowers who are often smaller and more informationally opaque. We re-estimate Eq. (4) on subsamples of loans based on loan type (Panel A of Table 10) and borrowers' credit rating status (Panel B of Table 10).\\nTable 10.

FIRSTYEAR_VIO takes the value of 1 if the first covenant violation date falls within 1 year from the facility start date and zero otherwise. PVIOL is the aggregate probability of covenant violation proposed by Demerjian and Owens (2016), which considers both the number of covenants and initial slack of each covenant in a contract. Columns 1–3 (Panel A) exhibit results estimated for all loans, term loans, and revolving loans, respectively. Columns 4–6 (Panel B) exhibit results estimated for loans made to investment grade (IG), non-investment grade (Non-IG) and unrated borrowers, respectively. SP500/GFC dummies, industry controls, and loan purpose controls are included in all regressions, but their coefficients are not reported. Industry controls are based on GICS.

This result provides evidence that non-co-opted independent directors may be the most effective monitors where monitoring is most valued. The monitoring effectiveness of non-co-opted independent directors is reinforced in Column 6 of Panel B, where we find a negative and significant coefficient (at the 5% level) among loans to unrated borrowers. Unrated firms with a higher percentage of non-co-opted independent directors on their board are less likely to violate covenants. It is also worth noting that PVIOL remains a strong predictor for probability of covenant violation across all columns except Column 6 in Panel B. Overall, the results emphasize the role of board monitoring in mitigating ex post covenant violations, but only among certain groups of borrowers and loans where values of monitoring are most pronounced.\\n9. Conclusion\\nThis study analyzed the monitoring effectiveness of the board through co-opted directors who are appointed after the CEO takes office. It examined how co-opted boards impact the ex ante intensity of loan covenants and their ex post violations.\\nUsing data on loan facilities and covenants from DealScan, this study provided loan market evidence suggesting that creditors associate co-opted boards with weaker monitoring. The findings reflected that a higher proportion of co-opted directors on the board resulted in the firm facing tighter covenants. This result is robust to various approaches accounting for endogeneity. Further tests revealed that co-option is not capturing the effect of CEO tenure, director inexperience, or CEO's involvement in the nominating committee. The findings also showed that co-opted boards are indeed less effective monitors. Firms whose boards comprise more co-opted directors face a higher incidence of covenant violation within 1 year after loan origination.\\nIn additional analyses, we found that a higher fraction of co-opted directors on the board is suggestive of weaker monitoring, regardless of directors' independence. This was exemplified by tighter covenants on loan contracts. It was further revealed that lenders view non-co-opted and independent directors as effective monitors and their increasing numbers reduce covenant intensity. With regards to ex post performance, we documented that firms whose boards comprise more non-co-opted and independent directors offer stronger internal monitoring benefits and help mitigate covenant violations among unrated borrowers and revolving loans.\\nThere are practical implications from the results in this study for all participants in the U.S. loan market. For borrowers, it highlights the importance of board mechanics in the firm. There is an incentive to devote more attention to the proportion of co-opted directors on the board since it undermines the effectiveness of monitoring and increases both covenant intensity and likelihood of violations. Borrowers can use this as a signalling tool to indicate that it is a “candidate of lesser trouble” (i.e. lower moral hazard). Firms striving to reduce covenant-related costs should have controls and mechanisms in place to keep the CEO's influence on board member selection and co-opted directors under scrutiny. For lenders, the results imply that the proportion and type of director appointment can provide a preliminary assessment of any potential monitoring costs. Since a less co-opted board is associated with better monitoring, the lenders' need to impose tighter covenants may be reduced. Consequently, lenders should expect lower eventual covenant violations. For regulators, it may be a worthy consideration to factor in co-opted directors in new policies since their presence makes board monitoring less effective. Co-opted boards may not only fall short of their accountability to shareholders in monitoring the firm; they also have the potential to be manipulated by the CEO to serve vested interests.\\nAcknowledgements\\nThe authors would like to express their gratitude for the helpful comments received from the editor (William L Megginson), two anonymous referees, Stephen Brown, Neal Galpin, Lyndon Moore, and participants at the 2018 University of Newcastle Research Seminar (Newcastle, Australia), 2019 Asian Finance Association Conference (Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam), 2019 Paris Financial Management Conference (Paris, France), and 2019–2020 Monash Brown Bag Seminar and Workshop (Melbourne, Australia).

(2019)\\nWe thank an anonymous referee for suggesting this useful diagnostic testing method, developed by Oster (2019), to examine the possibility of omitted variable bias. Oster (2019)’s technique was developed for OLS regression with underlying assumptions about R-squared, while our baseline regression is Poisson. We follow the adaptation by Heimer et al. (2019) whose baseline model is an ordered logit model. They estimated their model via both ordered logit and OLS, and documented that the changes in coefficients between regressions with and without controls are comparable across two estimation techniques. Therefore, Oster (2019) test inferences for OLS can be applied to their ordered logit model.\\nIn our case, the Poisson estimation is very similar to Heimer et al. (2019)’s ordered logit model. We closely replicate their adaptation by re-estimating our regressions (with and without controls) via both Poisson and OLS. Table A1 shows that the coefficient change between the regression without controls (Base) and that with controls (Controlled Effect) is similar across OLS and Poisson.\\nTable A1. Coefficient stability test via Oster (2019)’s method.\\nDependent variable CI_INDEX\\nModel Base Controlled Effect\\nOLS Coefficient on CO_OPTION 0.378 0.241\\nPoisson Coefficient on CO_OPTION 0.265 0.219\\nδ 6.792\\nOLS R-squared 0.025 0.412\\nThis table presents results from estimating δ via Oster (2019)’s method. The estimated δ indicates the degree of selection on unobservables relative to observables necessary to explain away any results due to omitted variable bias. The coefficients on CO_OPTION are obtained from estimating Eq. (1) via OLS and Poisson. The Base model has no control variable while the Controlled Effect model includes all control variables as listed in Table 2. The definitions of all variables are provided in Appendix 1. To calculate δ, we set R-squared max to be 1.3 times that of the observed R-squared from the OLS estimation with all controls.\\nFollowing Oster (2019), we set R-squared max to be 1.3 times that of the observed R-squared from the OLS estimation with all controls (since Poisson estimation does not produce R-squared). Our estimated δ using the Stata function psacalc developed by Oster (2019) is 6.792, which is greater than one. This result provides statistical evidence that our baseline regression is unlikely to be subject to omitted variable bias. We explained in footnote 9 that even though omitted variable bias is statistically unlikely to affect our baseline regression according to Oster (2019)’s method, we cannot entirely rule out its possibility. Hence, we carefully addressed this potential bias via two channels of exogenous shocks, including the change in exchange listing requirements around 2002 (SOX), and voluntary CEO turnovers.\",\n",

       "  'body': \"1. Introduction\\nBank capital acts as a buffer to absorb losses and is particularly important for financial stability in periods of adverse economic conditions. Insufficient bank capital levels in the banking system hinder its ability to create liquidity and support economic growth. For this reason, stress tests aiming at evaluating the resilience of the banking system under adverse economic shocks are a very important component of the regulatory framework in the banking systems worldwide. The objective of stress tests is therefore to ensure that banks hold – at all times – an adequate amount of capital to withstand such shocks and sustain their credit supply. This is important because recent contributions have shown that the costs of bank bailouts are very large.1\\nIn late February 2009, the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (SCAP) was launched to measure the ability of the 19 largest U.S. financial institutions to withstand future economic crises. These were domestic bank holding companies (BHCs) with year-end 2008 assets exceeding $100 billion. Since 2011, the Federal Reserve has conducted the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR). From 2014, the stress testing exercise has been expanded to include all BHCs with total assets exceeding $50 billion.\\nAnnual stress tests have been shown to lead to changes in the risk management practices of BHCs (Acharya et al., 2018; Cornett et al., 2020). Participating banks tend to avoid investments that require high capital buffer according to the stress tests. To maximize the probability of passing the tests, these banks have the incentive to align their internal risk evaluation processes with the stress tests' criteria. Since stress tests take a more forward-looking perspective when evaluating bank risk, the annual implementation of stress tests should improve the supervision of bank capital. Nevertheless, there are concerns that stress tests might lead to constraints on the ability of banks to create liquidity – an essential function of banks (Diamond and Dybvig, 1983).\\nIn this paper, we are the first to provide empirical evidence on the impact of stress tests (SCAP and CCAR) on the liquidity creation of U.S. banks. We focus on liquidity creation because, alongside risk transformation (Bhattacharya and Thakor, 1993; Diamond and Rajan, 2001), it is one of the key functions of banks, which supports the economy (Berger et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2018). Liquidity is created when banks transform relatively liquid liabilities (e.g., demand deposits) into relatively illiquid assets (e.g., corporate loans). Liquidity can also be created off the balance sheet, as is the case when banks extend loan commitments or lines of credits to businesses. Liquidity creation is a better measure of bank output than bank loans because it considers not only bank assets (in particular, loans), but also off-balance sheet activities, demand deposits, equity, and other bank liabilities (Berger and Sedunov, 2017). By creating liquidity, banks promote economic growth and improve capital allocation in the financial system.\\nExisting literature suggests that capital support and government interventions affect bank liquidity creation (Berger et al., 2016), while stress tests lead to a reduction in credit supply of U.S. banks (Acharya et al., 2018). These studies suggest that government intervention and stress tests may reduce liquidity creation by banks. However, at present, there is no empirical work on the effect of stress tests on bank liquidity creation. This is the question that this paper aims to answer empirically. We employ a regression discontinuity approach that relies on the Federal Reserve's selection criterion to include banks in the stress tests as an exogenous source of variation and provide evidence that regulatory stress tests reduce banks' liquidity creation both on- and off-balance sheets. A test for the continuity of the density of the distance between the bank size and the threshold, which is the running variable in our regression discontinuity method, suggests that banks do not manipulate their balance sheets to avoid being included in the stress tests. We acknowledge that it is difficult to precisely gauge the impact of Federal Reserve stress tests on U.S. bank liquidity creation because so many government intervention programs, regulatory/policy actions, and financial market events occurred around the same time. Even so, we argue that our empirical design and additional robustness tests help mitigate some of the concerns.\\nOur main findings are as follows. First, consistent with the risk-management hypothesis discussed in Acharya et al. (2018), our results show that banks manage their risk exposures by cutting down the asset-side component of liquidity creation, particularly to risky borrowers, in order to meet the higher capital standards of the stress tests. Second, we document an increase in the liability-side liquidity creation. However, the result does not suggest that banks become riskier following the stress tests as customer savings deposits make up around 70–80% of the total liquid liabilities of stress test banks. Therefore, this result indicates that stress tests encourage banks to adopt a more stable funding structure. This happens plausibly because banks have an incentive to rely on more liquid and relatively cheaper funding sources to increase their profits as a consequence of the decrease in asset-side liquidity creation. Third, stress test banks are found to reduce liquidity creation as they enter the stress tests for the first time, and in the quarters when the stress tests start, to avoid failing the tests. For some components of liquidity creation, such behavior becomes even more pronounced in subsequent quarters.\\nWe perform a number of robustness checks. First, we conduct the parallel trends test for the differences in the liquidity creation growth rate of stress test banks vis-à-vis non-stress test banks in the quarters prior to the stress tests. Second, we present the estimates of regression discontinuity under the local randomization inference, which is based on a ‘stronger’ alternative identification assumption. Third, we perform placebo tests by employing alternative cutoff values of $40, $60, $70, $80, $90, and $110 billion in total assets as the criterion for BHCs to be included in the stress tests. Fourth, we include in our sample BHCs with foreign parents and those with total assets exceeding $10 billion. Our empirical results remain robust to these additional checks.\\nOur paper contributes to two strands of literature: the literature on bank liquidity creation and the literature on the impact of stress tests on bank conduct. Motivated by the work of Berger and Bouwman (2009), recent studies have investigated the relationship between liquidity creation and the following variables: regulatory capital (e.g., Casu et al., 2019; Fu et al., 2016; Fungáčová et al., 2017; Horvath et al., 2014; Tran et al., 2016), competition (e.g., Horvath et al., 2016; Jiang et al., 2019), corporate governance (e.g., Andreou et al., 2016; Diaz and Huang, 2017; Huang et al., 2018), monetary policy (e.g., Berger and Bouwman, 2017), enforcement actions (e.g., Danisewicz et al., 2018), and real economic output (e.g., Berger and Sedunov, 2017). Moreover, Bowe et al. (2019) investigate the impact of capital requirement reforms (incorporated in the Third Basel Capital Accord), the Troubled Asset Relief Program, and unconventional monetary policy on bank liquidity creation. The strand of literature on regulatory stress tests has investigated the impact of stress tests on banks' lending and risk exposure (Acharya et al., 2018), and banks' capital and dividend payouts (Cornett et al., 2020). However, despite the important implications of regulatory stress tests on banks' business practices, to the best of our knowledge, there is no empirical study documenting the impact of stress tests on U.S. bank liquidity creation.\\nOur empirical findings indicate that there might be a trade-off between the positive effects of stress tests, in terms of enhanced long-term financial stability, and the temporary negative effects on liquidity creation. This finding is important because Berger and Sedunov (2017) find that there is a positive relation between bank liquidity creation and real economic output. Thus, our findings have important implications for policy makers and bank regulators, given that stress tests might temporarily have an unintended adverse impact on the real economy. In this respect, our study is similar to the recent paper by Danisewicz et al. (2018), which reports a reduction in bank liquidity creation in response to regulatory enforcement actions, which ultimately leads to temporary adverse effects on local economic growth.2 In addition to stress tests and enforcement actions, changes in regulatory requirements can influence the real economy via the lending channel. For example, Bindal et al. (2020) suggest that the size-based regulatory thresholds introduced by the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 have had an impact on small-business lending and, ultimately, the real economy. Importantly, our empirical findings do not imply that stress tests should be avoided. In the long-term, the improved stability in the financial system arising from stress test exercises might offset the temporary economic costs resulting from a reduction in liquidity creation by banks.\\nAn additional contribution of this paper to the literature on the impact of stress tests on bank conduct is the extended sample period. While previous empirical studies focus solely on the first stress test (e.g., Connolly, 2018) or extend the analysis to include the 2014 stress test (e.g., Acharya et al., 2018; Shahhosseini, 2015), our paper covers more recent stress tests in 2015 and 2016. Moreover, Acharya et al. (2018) and Connolly (2018) examine the lending implications after the implementation of the stress tests, whereas our paper explores the response of banks as they enter the stress tests. Finally, our research goes beyond the empirical analyses conducted by Acharya et al. (2018) and Connolly (2018), because not only do we consider bank lending, we also investigate the impact of stress tests on bank liquidity creation on both sides of the balance sheet (assets and liabilities) as well as liquidity creation originated by off-the-balance sheet items.\\nFrom a policy viewpoint, this paper suggests that, in the short-term, stress tests may be detrimental to financial intermediation. Our findings, however, also show that banks tend to increase liquidity creation on the liability-side in response to the stress tests. Since liquid liabilities consist mainly of customer deposits, our results indicate that banks may shift to a more stable funding structure as a result of stress tests. This finding is very important because literature on the impact of stress tests has so far neglected the liability-side of banks' balance sheets.\\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides background on regulatory stress testing. Section 3 offers a literature review on regulatory stress testing. Section 4 introduces the data and the variables of interest. Section 5 discusses the methodology, the empirical results, and the findings. Section 6 presents the study summary and provides policy implications.\\n2. Institutional background\\nStress testing of large and systemically important financial institutions is one of the main prudential tools for enhanced supervision in the post-crisis regulatory reforms, many of which came from the passage of the well-known Dodd-Frank Act (DFA). After the financial crisis of 2007–2009, the U.S. banking system suffered from low capital positions and substantial risk exposures due to deteriorating macroeconomic conditions. In 2010, the DFA required that all BHCs with total consolidated assets exceeding $50 billion and non-bank financial institutions that are deemed systemically important by the Financial Stability Oversight Council be subject to the annual stress tests conducted by the Federal Reserve. Supervisory stress tests involve estimation of banks' expected capital levels according to their fundamentals under the baseline and various adverse economic scenarios (Hirtle and Lehnert, 2015), while allowing for simultaneous assessment and comparison of exposures across banks (Hirtle et al., 2009). The results are then disclosed to the public and banks that fail the stress tests are subject to corrective actions.\\nThe first stress test under the SCAP was launched by the Federal Reserve System in 2009 in response to the 2007–2009 financial crisis. The SCAP is a forward-looking exercise, which departs from traditional supervisory exercises based on backward-looking information. The purpose of the SCAP is to assess additional capital buffer that is deemed necessary to maintain credit supply under deteriorating economic conditions. All BHCs with assets exceeding $100 billion were subject to the stress test. Their revenues, expenses, losses, and capital ratios were projected under several economic scenarios. The outcomes of the stress test were disclosed to the public in May 2009. These include BHCs' Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 common capital and risk-weighted assets as of year-end 2008. Then, the capital levels for year-end 2010 were estimated on the basis of projections of banks' fundamentals under adverse scenarios.3 The BHCs involved in the stress test were expected to have the Tier 1 risk-based capital and the Tier 1 common capital ratios at the end of 2010 above the supervisory benchmarks of 6% and 4%, respectively. The required SCAP additional capital buffer, which is the difference between the supervisory capital benchmark and the capital level estimated under the adverse scenario, was also included in the public release.\\nThe results of the SCAP suggested that the aggregate capital needed for the 19 BHCs to meet the SCAP requirements was $185 billion, the majority of which was in the form of Tier 1 common capital. The aggregate supplemental capital needs were $75 billion after adjusting for the operating performance of the first quarter of 2009 for ten BHCs that were deemed insufficiently capitalized. Banks with an insufficient capital buffer were required to submit plans, which include details regarding how the capital buffer gap problem would be addressed. Nine out of ten BHCs that failed the stress test subsequently managed to raise sufficient capital privately. The substantial recapitalization of BHCs following the SCAP was widely regarded as a success of post-crisis regulatory actions in improving financial health of the U.S. banking system.\\nFrom 2011, the Federal Reserve started conducting the annual CCAR for the same BHCs that participated in the SCAP with an aim to determine if large U.S. banks had sufficient capital to withstand negative economic shocks and maintained credit lending under adverse conditions. From 2014, the stress test expanded to all BHCs with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more. The CCAR requires participating BHCs to submit their internal stress test results and capital plans. The BHCs also go through a qualitative review of their risk management and internal capital planning processes. The quantitative assessment of CCAR requires that BHCs' capital ratios must be maintained at or above the regulatory levels. The capital plans of BHCs submitted to the authority describe details of their capital adequacy assessing processes, intended capital actions and distributions (e.g., dividend payments, capital issuances, and repurchases) for the next nine quarters. With BHCs' planned capital actions, the Federal Reserve System carries out the stress tests to project revenues, expenses, losses, and post-stress capital ratios for each bank under the three defined scenarios (i.e., ‘baseline’, ‘adverse’, and ‘severely adverse’). The scenarios place more emphasis on the system-wide rather than the idiosyncratic risks of banks with an aim to reduce the likelihood of banks collectively facing constraints on capital under severe economic conditions. The ability of banks to maintain the post-stress capital ratios above the regulatory requirements is assessed by the Federal Reserve. The outcome of the CCAR is determined by the Federal Reserve System, taking into consideration the stress test results and the qualitative assessments of the banks' capital plans. In the CCAR, the Federal Reserve can object to a bank's capital plan and distributions on either quantitative or qualitative grounds or both. The objection of the plan may lead to restrictions in the distributions of bank capital, such as share repurchases or dividend payments.\\nOverall, the purpose of stress testing exercises is to provide a comprehensive assessment of capital adequacy and incentives for banks to undertake better risk management practices. Stress tests also take into account macroprudential risks in the assessment of bank capital positions, which depart from traditional supervision and regulation practices that involve setting capital rules that place more emphasis on bank idiosyncratic risks. By requiring banks to operate with sufficient capital buffers so that their financial intermediation function in stressed economic scenarios is maintained, it is argued that stress testing promotes the resilience of BHCs and reduces the systemic risk of the entire financial system in U.S.\\n3. Literature review and hypothesis development\\n3.1. Literature on stress testing models\\nThe literature on stress tests is relatively new and still growing. Several recent papers highlight the importance of stress tests as a supervisory tool and evaluate the costs and benefits of different design choices (see, for example, Hirtle and Lehnert, 2015, Schuermann, 2014, and references therein). Other studies attempt to develop alternative models and approaches to carry out stress tests (see, among others, Acharya et al., 2014, Covas et al., 2014, Kapinos and Mitnik, 2016, Kupiec, 2018). Recent theoretical contributions focus on how stress tests can affect bank lending (Shapiro and Zeng, 2018) and how to develop an optimal disclosure policy for the stress test results (Leitner and Williams, 2018). The latter topic is very important because of a debate on whether disclosing the results of stress tests enhances financial stability. For example, while Goldstein and Sapra (2014) argue that disclosure of the stress test results promotes financial stability but may worsen inefficiencies of individual banks. In this regard, Corona et al. (2017) suggest that it may lead to excessive bank risk-taking and an increase in bank failures.\\n3.2. Stress tests and market implications\\nRecent empirical research on the impact of stress tests mostly relies on event studies to investigate the information content of stress tests and their financial market implications. Studying the events related to the SCAP, Morgan et al. (2014) show that stress test banks with larger capital deficiencies experience more negative abnormal returns. Fernandes et al. (2020) examine the price and trade reactions around the stress tests and document positive market reactions to the test announcements. Similarly, Flannery et al. (2017) find that stress tests provide information not only about the participating BHCs but also the fundamentals of the banking industry. Studies using data on European banks also confirm that stress tests offer valuable information to market participants (Petrella and Resti, 2013) and may help the market detect fragile banks (Carboni et al., 2017).4 Finally, several recent studies focus on the potential spillover effects of the release of the stress test results – either to other banks or to sovereigns (Breckenfelder and Schwaab, 2018; Goncharenko et al., 2018).\\n3.3. Stress tests, bank capital and lending\\nAs the consequence of failing stress tests can be severe, stress tests are likely to influence the behavior of participating banks. An emerging strand of literature attempts to quantify the effects of stress tests on bank credit provision and loan pricing (Acharya et al., 2018; Berrospide and Edge, 2019; Calem et al., 2019; Connolly, 2018; Cortés et al., 2020; Lambertini and Mukherjee, 2016), capital ratios (Cornett et al., 2020), loan loss provisions and non-performing loans (Shahhosseini, 2015), risk taking (Pierret and Steri, 2018), and entrepreneurship and innovation (Doerr, 2019). Other studies (see Bindal et al., 2020; Bordo and Duca, 2018; Bouwman et al., 2018; Kovner and Van Tassel, 2018) focus on the impact of the DFA on banks conduct, merger and acquisition behavior, and lending and the cost of capital. Studies focusing on European banks find that anticipation of stress tests can lead banks to reduce their risk-weighted assets instead of raising their levels of equity to increase capital ratios (Eber and Minoiu, 2017; Gropp et al., 2018). A summary of the literature documenting the effects of stress tests on banks' behavior is given in Table A1 of the Appendix.\\n3.4. Hypotheses development: Impact of stress tests on bank liquidity creation\\nBanks that participate in the stress tests are required to have more capital relative to their credit risk exposure. Higher capital ratios can be achieved by reducing credit supply and substituting loans with relatively safer assets such as Treasury securities, especially when raising capital is costly (Acharya et al., 2018; Berger and Udell, 1994; Brinkmann and Horvitz, 1995; Thakor, 1996). Higher capital ratios induced by the stress tests can also affect bank lending through other channels. Thakor (1996), among others, maintains that tighter capital requirement leads to increased banks' funding costs. Higher capital reduces creditors' risk which could result in weakened market discipline, reduced monitoring incentive, and increased costs of funding (Calomiris and Kahn, 1991). With limited ability to pass these costs to borrowers due to competition, lending becomes less attractive to banks. For this reason, tighter capital requirements result in credit contractions. Supporting this view, De Jonghe et al. (2020) find evidence that higher capital requirements correspond to lower credit supply to firms and this credit contraction largely affects risky borrowers. Furthermore, as stress test banks are required to hold more capital against their risky lending, they may reduce moral hazard, induced by limited liability or government protection/guarantee, by restricting credit supply to risky borrowers (Acharya et al., 2016; Berger and Bouwman, 2013). In other words, the risk-management hypothesis predicts that the higher capital requirement of the stress tests may lead to the adjustment of banks' portfolios that involves reductions in lending activities – particularly to risky borrowers (Acharya et al., 2018). Since credit lending is a key component of liquidity creation, bank liquidity creation declines as a result.\\nOn the other hand, the moral hazard hypothesis suggests that requiring certain BHCs to participate in the stress tests may increase the moral hazard incentives of banks to take on more credit risk as these BHCs may be deemed systemically important to maintain a healthy banking industry (Acharya et al., 2018). Also, stress test banks may have lower returns as a result of increased capital and may engage in reaching-for-yield behavior by expanding credit lending to riskier borrowers (Acharya et al., 2018). Furthermore, it is argued that as capital enhances banks' safety and resilience, higher capital buffers as a consequence of the new regulatory framework are likely to improve their ability to expand credit provision (Berger and Udell, 1994; Berger and Bouwman, 2009; Bhattacharya and Thakor, 1993; Coval and Thakor, 2005). In a recent paper, Bahaj and Malherbe (2018) predict that the positive relationship between capital requirements and provision of credit is more likely at high levels of capital where banks have a low probability of failure. Although higher capital requirement reduces the value of implicit subsidy from a government guarantee, the extent to which the marginal loan is subsidized can increase, which leads to a lower marginal funding cost and increased bank credit lending. Similarly, higher capital can reduce banks' costs of funding, especially wholesale funding which is more sensitive to banks' risk (Berger and Bouwman, 2013), improve banks' access to the risky debt markets (Carlson et al., 2013), thereby increasing the provision of credit (Chu et al., 2019). Higher capital can also strengthen market discipline, providing stronger incentives for banks to monitor borrowers (Mehran and Thakor, 2011). These lead to improved credit access for borrowers. As a consequence of increased credit provision, bank liquidity creation may increase in response to regulatory stress tests.\\nTheories on the role of regulatory capital on bank liquidity creation yield conflicting predictions. Liquidity creation can be related to regulatory capital in two opposing ways. First, according to the ‘financial fragility – crowding out’ hypothesis, the relationship between liquidity creation and capital is negative. As banks gather funds from depositors to issue loans, they are inherently fragile, because they are exposed to the risk of bank runs in the absence of complete deposit insurance (Diamond and Rajan, 2000, Diamond and Rajan, 2001). With the informational advantage obtained from monitoring borrowers, the bank may extract rents from depositors, withhold monitoring or repayment collection efforts. Given the agency problem between the bank and depositors, depositors may be reluctant to provide funds. Therefore, such fragility is necessary because threats of premature withdrawal of demand deposits act as a disciplinary device (Calomiris and Kahn, 1991). This fragility commits the banks to monitor borrowers and collect repayments, allowing them to create liquidity by granting more loans with more deposits. Because a higher capital ratio reduces the probability of financial distress, regulators can impose capital requirements to reduce fragility in the banking system. However, capital requirements, if binding, force banks to shift from deposit holdings to equity (Gorton and Winton, 2000). Since deposits are liquid liabilities, liquidity creation decreases eventually.\\nOn the contrary, the ‘risk absorption’ hypothesis points to a positive relationship between bank capital and liquidity creation. Bank risk increases with liquidity creation because it increases the expected loss resulting from sales of illiquid assets for liquidity reasons (see, among others, Allen and Gale, 2004, Allen and Santomero, 1997). In other words, given the mismatch between liquid liabilities and illiquid assets, the more liquidity banks create, the higher default risk they may face. Therefore, banks' liquidity creation increases their exposure to the risk of being unable to satisfy unexpected liquidity demands from customers and the associated losses of liquidating illiquid assets to meet such demands. For this reason, banks need to hold more capital to improve their solvency, which may allow them to obtain external funding on short notice or at lower costs. In addition, since well-capitalized banks tend to have higher risk absorption capacity, they are in a stronger position to create liquidity (Bhattacharya and Thakor, 1993; Coval and Thakor, 2005; Repullo, 2004; von Thadden, 2004). A recent study by Donaldson et al. (2018), which does not provide support for either hypothesis, shows that higher capital ratios enhance bank liquidity creation.\\nFollowing these two competing theories, regulatory stress tests may either increase or reduce bank liquidity creation. This leads to two alternative hypotheses to be tested in this paper:\\nHypothesis 1\\nRisk-management/crowding out hypothesis – Regulatory stress tests have a negative impact on bank liquidity creation.\\nHypothesis 2\\nMoral hazard/risk absorption hypothesis – Regulatory stress tests have a positive impact on bank liquidity creation.\\n4. Data and variables\\n4.1. Data\\nWe collect data from a number of sources. Financial data is obtained from the Consolidated Financial Statements for BHCs (FR-Y9C). Bank liquidity creation measures are obtained from Christa Bouwman's website.5 All variables are aggregated to the highest holder level. Our sample period starts in 2007Q1 and ends in 2016Q4. The 19 BHCs considered for the SCAP are: Ally Financial Inc., American Express Company, Bank of America Corporation, Bank of New York Mellon Corporation, BB&T Corporation, Capital One Financial Corporation, Citigroup Inc., Fifth Third Bancorp, Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co., KeyCorp, Metlife Inc., Morgan Stanley, PNC Financial Services Group Inc., Regions Financial Corporation, State Street Corporation, Suntrust Banks Inc., U.S. Bancorp, and Wells Fargo & Company.\\nMetlife Inc. did not participate in the 2013 CCAR as its commercial banking division was sold out and was not deemed a BHC in 2012. The 2014 CCAR was expanded to all BHCs with total assets exceeding $50 billion, increasing the total number of eligible BHCs, which were subject to the stress tests to 30. The new 12 BHCs include: BBVA Compass Bancshares Inc., BMO Financial Corp., Comerica Incorporated, Discover Financial Services, HSBC North America Holdings Inc., Huntington Bancshares Incorporated, M&T Bank Corporation, Northern Trust Corporation, RBS Citizens Financial Group Inc., Santander Holdings USA Inc., UnionBanCal Corporation, and Zions Bancorporation. The 2015 CCAR added Deutsche Bank Trust Corporation to the list of stress test banks. BancWest and TD Group were included in the 2016 CCAR. Metlife Inc. is removed from the sample as it is an insurance company and not comparable to other BHCs. This study relies on the website of the Federal Reserve's National Information Center to identify BHCs with assets greater than $20 billion as non-stress test banks.6 The complete list of stress test banks over the sample period is provided in Table A2 of the Appendix.\\n4.2. Liquidity creation measures\\nOur liquidity creation measures are based on the methodology proposed by Berger and Bouwman (2009). Specifically, liquidity creation (LC) is defined as the ‘cat fat’ liquidity creation measure and accounts for both on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet items, which are classified by category. Loan items are classified by category rather than by maturity because for the construction of liquidity creation measures, loan maturity is less important than the ability of banks to securitize and sell loans. LC measure is further broken down into on- and off-balance sheet liquidity creation measures as Berger and Bouwman (2009) find that, for large banks, half of the liquidity is created off the balance sheet. We utilize LCON, which is the liquidity creation measure that only includes on-balance sheet items and LCOFF, which is the off-balance sheet component of LC. Furthermore, we employ LCA and LCL, which are the asset and the liability components of liquidity creation, respectively. All the measures of liquidity creation are normalized by gross total assets, denoted by GTA. Table A3 in the Appendix provides details of the construction of liquidity creation measures.\\n4.3. Control variables\\nTo control for bank-specific characteristics, a number of bank control variables are included in the liquidity creation regressions. One of them is the bank size (SIZE), which is the natural logarithm of gross total assets. It is important to account for credit risk as it helps to isolate the effect of capital on liquidity creation from the role of capital in supporting the risk transformation function of banks (Berger and Bouwman, 2009). We proxy for credit risk using the ratio of non-performing loans to total loans (NPL) as in Du and Palia (2018). We also control for bank capitalization, denoted by CAP, which is measured by the ratio of equity to total assets (Berger and Bouwman, 2009). To account for bank profitability, we use return on equity (ROE), which is the ratio of net income to equity (Casu et al., 2019). In robustness checks, we further include banks with foreign parents. The information about foreign banks can be found on the website of the Federal Reserve's National Information Center. The definitions of the variables used in our empirical analyses are given in Table 1.\\nTable 1.

Data description\\nTable 2 reports the descriptive statistics for the liquidity creation measures as well as the control variables of interest. The average liquidity creation, LC, appears to be 54.44%, while the averages of LCON and LCOFF are 26.34% and 28.10%, respectively. Consistent with Berger and Bouwman (2009), who find that for large banks half of the liquidity is created off the balance sheet, the mean value of LCOFF in our sample is greater than that of LCON. It can be seen from Table 2 that the average of LCL is 20.33%, which is much higher than the average of LCA (6.01%), suggesting that the banks in our sample appear to create more liquidity on the liability side than on the asset side of the balance sheet. As for the control variables, the average of return on equity, ROE, is 4.39%. Table 2 also shows that the average capital ratio, CAP, of the banks over the sample period is 10.95%, while the mean of non-performing loans to total loans ratio, NPL, is 2.36%.\\nTable 2.

LC is the liquidity creation. LCON is the on-the balance sheet liquidity creation measure. LCOFF is the off-balance sheet liquidity creation. LCA and LCL denote asset and liability components of liquidity creation, respectively. Stress is the dummy equal to 1 if the bank is subject to the stress test and 0 otherwise. Assignment represents the distance between bank size (natural logarithm of gross total assets) and the normalized cutoffs. ROE is the return on equity, SIZE is the natural logarithm of gross total assets, CAP is the equity to total assets, and NPL is the total non-performing loans to total loans.\\nFig. 1 plots the evolution of LC, over time, for the stress test banks and the non-stress test banks. The graph shows a marked reduction in LC from around $4300 billion in 2008:Q4 to $3500 billion in 2009:Q4 for the stress test banks, but not for the non-stress test banks. Such a pattern, however, is not clear in the following periods. For this reason, in the subsequent econometric analysis we present tests that exclude the first stress testing exercise to ensure the robustness of our results.\\nDownload : Download high-res image (260KB)Download : Download full-size image\\nFig. 1.

Univariate analysis\\nThe results of the univariate analysis for the differences in the means and the medians of the main variables of the banks in the sample are reported in Table 3. The empirical examination includes all stress test and non-stress test banks in sample. Following Cornett et al. (2020), we divide our sample into three subperiods: year 2007, which is the year before the financial crisis and before the stress testing exercises; year 2009, which is the first year of the stress testing program; and the 2009–2016 period, which includes data for the full-sample. Once a BHC is classified as a stress test bank in a particular year, its quarterly observations in that year are included in the stress test category.\\nTable 3.

For example, the LC ratios are 92.19% for stress test banks versus 47.78% for non-stress test banks. Similarly, LCOFF ratios are 71.07% and 17.78% for stress test banks and non-stress test banks, respectively. This is consistent with the finding of Berger and Bouwman (2009) that large banks create more than half of their liquidity off the balance sheet. Nevertheless, non-stress test banks as a group appear to have a higher average LCON ratio than stress test banks (29.99% versus 22.12%). Stress test banks also have a lower average LCA ratio (7.73%) in comparison with non-stress test banks (14.7%).\\nIn 2009, which is the first year of stress testing, non-stress test banks see no significant changes in the liquidity creation ratios when comparing column (5) to column (1). As for stress test banks, by comparing column (7) to column (3), it can be seen that their liquidity creation ratios have been significantly reduced during 2007 and 2009. Notably, the mean of LC in 2007 for stress test banks is 92.19%, which decreases to 59.61% in 2009. Similarly, both LCON and LCOFF ratios also decrease from 21.12% to 14.49% and from 71.07% to 45.12%, respectively, and both are statistically significant at the 10% and the 5% levels, respectively. Stress test banks appear to cut down their asset-side liquidity creation, LCA, from 7.73% in 2007 to 1.14% in 2009. The difference between the two estimates is statistically significant at the 5% level.\\nComparing the results for 2007 (column (1)) and the period between 2009 and 2016 (column (9)), there are no significant changes in the total liquidity creation ratio, LC, for non-stress test banks, while there is a marginal increase in the liquidity creation on the balance sheet, LCON (34.69% versus 29.99%). In contrast, when comparing column (11) to column (3), stress test banks appear to have a lower liquidity creation, LC, on average during 2009–2016, decreasing from 92.19% in 2007 to 51.81%. The LCOFF ratio also falls from 71.07% in 2007 to 33.14% (also statistically different at the 1% significance level). Similarly, there is a decrease in the asset-side liquidity creation, LCA, to 0.1% in 2009–2016 (also statistically different at the 1% significance level). However, the liability-side liquidity creation, LCL, appears to increase during 2009–2016 to 18.57% in comparison with 13.38% in 2007 (again, statistically different at the 1% significance level). Overall, it appears that stress test banks reduce their liquidity creation as they enter the stress test, while no significant changes are observed for non-stress test banks.\\nTable A4 of the Appendix further presents the univariate analysis for the differences in the means of bank balance sheet items. When comparing columns (4) and (6) to column (2), the results suggest that stress test banks reduce illiquid assets following the stress tests. For example, in 2009 and during the 2009–2016 period, the ratios of commercial real estate loans, loans to finance agricultural production, commercial and industrial loans, and intangible assets and premises are smaller than those in 2007. The table also shows an increase in saving deposits ratio of stress test banks after the stress tests. As saving deposits are more liquid and tend to account for a large proportion of banks' total liquid liabilities, the finding is consistent with the reported increase in stress test banks' LCL. Finally, by comparing column (6) to column (2), there is evidence that stress test banks reduce illiquid off-balance sheet items (e.g., unused commitments, net standby letters of credit, and commercial and similar letters of credit), while increase more liquid components (e.g., interest rate derivatives and foreign exchange derivatives) following the stress tests.\\n5.2. Regression discontinuity design\\nWe exploit the Federal Reserve System's selection criterion for the stress tests as an exogenous source of variation to estimate the causal impact of stress tests on bank liquidity creation. Banks are selected on the basis of their size, and therefore stress test banks do not have counterparts that are not part of the stress test (Acharya et al., 2018; Cornett et al., 2020). In other words, the treatment status, which is conditional on bank size, is not driven by the outcome variables. This set-up allows us to employ a regression discontinuity (RD) approach to investigate the effect of regulatory stress tests on bank liquidity creation. The RD setting requires a known cutoff of a running variable in order to determine the treatment. The regulatory rule that obligates certain banks to participate in the stress tests provides a natural threshold and allows us to exploit the cross-sectional variation in the liquidity creation of stress test banks and non-stress test banks. The BHCs with total assets below the threshold fall naturally into the control group, while the treatment group consists of BHCs with total assets exceeding the threshold and therefore are subject to regulator stress tests.\\nThe RD method focuses on the treatment effect induced by the variation in the treatment assignment around the cutoff and overcomes the effects of other potential confounders. The average effect of the treatment on banks that are close to the cutoff can be obtained by comparing the average outcomes of observations just below and above the threshold.7 That is, the liquidity creation of banks just above the size cutoff subsequent to entering the stress tests is compared to the liquidity creation of banks that are exempt from the tests. In the absence of treatment, banks belonging to the treatment and the control groups are assumed to behave in a similar way. The identification strategy assumes that the assignment/running variable cannot be manipulated around the known threshold (see Lee and Lemieux, 2010). In other words, the validity of our RD estimation method rests on the assumption that banks do not have control over whether they are over the size limits or not, which in turn, determines whether or not they are subject to the stress tests.8\\nIn this paper, the local linear regression discontinuity is estimated non-parametrically, following Hahn et al. (2001), using the data closer to the cutoffs of $100 billion and $50 billion. The use of non-parametric approach is to mitigate the risk of misspecification, which is common in parametric analysis. The empirical approach is appealing as it reduces the bias arising from using the data farther away from the cutoff to estimate the discontinuity at the cutoff and the variation in the liquidity creation of banks near the size limits is attributable to the effect of the stress tests. The regression takes the following specification (see Lee and Lemieux, 2010; Roberts and Whited, 2013):\\n(1)\\nwhere Yit is a proxy for bank liquidity creation for bank i at time t. The dummy variable, Stressit, defines the treatment status and equals 1 if a bank is in the stress test group and 0 otherwise. As there was no stress test in 2010, Stressit takes the value of 0 for all banks in that year. The variable, Assignmentit, represents the distance between bank i's size (natural logarithm of gross total assets) and the cutoffs (normalized by natural logarithm). The interaction term, Stressit × Assignmentit, is included to capture the possible differences in the slope of the regression on both sides of the cutoff as explained in Bonner and Eijffinger (2016). Xit is a vector of control variables, and υi and γt represent bank fixed effects and time fixed effects, respectively.9 In our regression discontinuity estimations, robust standard errors are clustered at the bank level. We exclude bank size, SIZE, from the RD regressions because of its high correlation with the Assignment variable.\\nChoosing a bandwidth in the local linear non-parametric RD model involves a bias-variance trade-off. On the one hand, a smaller bandwidth uses a fewer number of observations around the cutoff, thereby reducing the potential estimator's bias that arises from specifying an incorrect functional form. But this comes at the expense of reduced statistical precision due to a smaller sample size. On the other hand, a wider bandwidth employs more observations, thus improving estimation precision at the expense of increased risk of bias. While there are a variety of approaches for choosing the optimal bandwidth for the RD model in the literature, the selection of bandwidth remains a subjective decision. It is, therefore, suggested that the best practice is to experiment with different bandwidths to demonstrate the robustness of the findings (Roberts and Whited, 2013). In this paper, the RD estimation is implemented using the optimal mean squared error (MSE-optimal) bandwidth that minimizes the mean square error following Imbens and Kalyanaraman (2012). As the choice of weighting kernel has been shown to have negligible impact on estimation in practice, we use the rectangular kernel as the weighting kernel.\\n5.2.1. Graphical analysis\\nFig. 2 plots the discontinuity estimates at the threshold for bank liquidity creation measures. The x-axis measures the distance between banks' size at the cutoff. Banks with size above the cutoff are to the right of the threshold, while those below the cutoff are to the left. The lines represent the fitted regression lines for models, which include up to the fourth-order polynomial term. Fig. 2 shows a clear discontinuity in bank liquidity creation measures at the cutoff. Specifically, within the proximity of the cutoff, stress test banks have lower total liquidity creation ratio, LC, than non-stress test banks. Similarly, other liquidity creation ratios (LCON, LCOFF, and LCA) of stress test banks are also lower than those of non-stress test banks, pointing to the negative impact of stress testing on bank liquidity creation. In contrast, the figure illustrates that the liability-side liquidity creation ratio, LCL, of stress test banks is higher than that of non-stress test counterparts.\\nDownload : Download high-res image (730KB)Download : Download full-size image\\nFig. 2. Regression discontinuity estimation using bank size to assign the treatment group.\\nThe figure shows the regression discontinuity (RD) results using a non-parametric approach that estimates the change in bank liquidity creation given that the bank is in the treatment group (stress test banks). The purpose is to show whether there is discontinuity in banks' measures of liquidity creation at the size cutoff ($100 billion or $50 billion). Distance from threshold is expressed in $ ten million. LC is the liquidity creation, LCON is the on-the balance sheet liquidity creation measure, LCOFF is the off-balance sheet liquidity creation, LCA is the asset component of liquidity creation, and LCL is the liability component of liquidity creation. Observations to the left (right) of the threshold belong to control group (treatment group).\\n5.2.2. Regression discontinuity estimation\\nWe use a RD approach that exploits the bank size cutoff and separates stress test banks from non-stress test banks. By comparing banks around this cutoff, we can identify the effect of regulatory stress tests on U.S. bank liquidity creation. As mentioned earlier, the RD method assumes that banks in the vicinity of the threshold cannot manipulate the treatment status. This requires that the density of the running variable be continuous around the threshold. We follow the methodology proposed by McCrary (2008) to test for the discontinuity of the density of the running variable. Fig. 3 plots the density of the running variable (in our case, Assignment). The x-axis represents the distance of banks' size from the stress test threshold and the y-axis represents the density of the running variable. The dots depict the density and the solid line represents the fitted density function of the running variable with a 95% confidence interval around the fitted line. A jump in the density at the threshold, if observed, is indicative of discontinuity and manipulations. The figure gives little indication of a strong discontinuity at the threshold. The discontinuity estimate of the density of the running variable is −0.1317 and is statistically insignificant at conventional levels. Therefore, the null hypothesis that the density of Assignment at the cutoff threshold is continuous cannot be rejected. Overall, it appears that banks do not manipulate their size with an aim to avoid being subject to the regulator stress tests.\\nDownload : Download high-res image (138KB)Download : Download full-size image\\nFig. 3. Density distribution of the bank size distance from the stress test threshold.\\nThe figure shows the density of the running variable to test for the discontinuity in the running variable following McCrary (2008). The x-axis represents the distance between the bank size and the threshold (Assignment) and the y-axis represents the density of the running variable. The dots represent the density and the solid line depicts the fitted density function of the running variable with a 95% confidence interval around the fitted line.\\nWe resort to a non-parametric local linear estimation with a rectangular kernel and the MSE-optimal bandwidth following Imbens and Kalyanaraman (2012). Table 4 reports the estimation results for the liquidity creation measures. The variable of interest is Stress, which captures the difference between stress test and non-stress test banks. For each of the measures of bank liquidity creation, we show the estimation results with and without control variables. We find that there is a negative and statistically significant discontinuity at the cutoff across all the measures of liquidity creation with the exception of the liability-side liquidity creation, LCL. For example, the estimated coefficients of Stress for the total liquidity creation, LC, (columns (1) and (2)) are −0.1161 and −0.1279, respectively, suggesting that banks reduce their liquidity creation when they are subject to the regulatory stress tests. The estimated effects are significant at the 1% significance level. Economically, the estimated coefficient of Stress in column (1) indicates that stress test banks reduce LC on average by around 11 percentage points relative to non-stress test banks. Since the sample mean for LC is around 54 percentage points, this reduction is around 21.4% of the sample mean. In column (2) the estimated reduction is around 23.5% of the sample mean. Considering the coefficient estimate of −0.6225 on Assignment and the coefficient estimate of 0.7019 on the interaction term, Stress × Assignment, in column (1), our result suggests that the reduction in LC actually becomes smaller as the bank becomes bigger, provided that the bank is included in the stress tests. In particular, an increase of (−0.6225 + 0.7019) × 1.4175 = 0.1125 ≈ 11% in the value of LC, evaluated at the sample mean, is associated with an increase of one-standard deviation in Assignment for stress test banks. The coefficient on the interaction term is interesting because it indicates that the impact of stress tests on LC is more pronounced for smaller banks closer to the cutoff than bigger banks, located farther away from the size cutoff. Similarly, the coefficient estimates of Stress for liquidity creation on the balance sheet, LCON, (columns (3) and (4)) are −0.0853 and −0.0914 and are statistically significant at the 5% and 1% levels, respectively.\\nTable 4.

The results are obtained using a pooled non-parametric approach with the rectangular kernel. All estimations use the optimal bandwidth following Imbens and Kalyanaraman (2012). The variable of interest is Stress, which defines the treatment status and is a dummy variable equal to 1 if a bank is in the stress test group and 0 otherwise. Assignment represents the distance between bank size (natural logarithm of gross total assets) and the normalized cutoffs. Robust standard errors are clustered at the bank level and reported in parentheses. LC is the liquidity creation, LCON is the on-the balance sheet liquidity creation measure, LCOFF is the off-balance sheet liquidity creation, LCA is the asset component of liquidity creation, LCL is the liability component of liquidity creation, CAP is the equity to total assets, ROE is the return on equity, and NPL is the total non-performing loans to total loans. ⁎⁎⁎, ⁎⁎, and ⁎ denote statistical significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels, respectively.\\nStress also reduces bank off-balance sheet liquidity creation. Specifically, the coefficient estimates of Stress for the liquidity creation off the balance sheet, LCOFF, (columns (5) and (6)) are −0.0362 and −0.0307, respectively (both are statistically significant at the 1% level). These results suggest that stress test banks reduce their off-balance sheet liquidity creation in response to regulatory stress tests, which may be due to the fact that off-balance sheet risk can materialize and contribute to the on-balance sheet risk. This may, in turn, affect the capital ratios of those banks that participate in the stress tests. As can be seen from Table 4, the coefficient estimates of Stress for the asset-side liquidity creation, LCA, (columns (7) and (8)) are −0.0849 and −0.0764, respectively, both of which are significant at the 1% significance level. These empirical findings are generally in line with Acharya et al. (2018), who document a reduction of credit supply of banks, especially to relatively risky borrowers. Stress test banks may attempt to cut down their risk exposure by shrinking their asset-side liquidity creation in an effort to increase their capital ratios. This is also consistent with Hyun and Rhee (2011) and Gropp et al. (2018), who provide evidence that banks shrink their risky assets instead of issuing new equity to meet higher capital requirements.\\nOn the contrary, the coefficient estimates of Stress for the liability-side liquidity creation, LCL, (columns (9) and (10)) are both positive (0.1090 and 0.1140, respectively) and statistically significant at the 1% level. The results imply that banks increase their liability-side liquidity creation in response to stress tests. Table A4 in the Appendix shows the univariate analysis of liquid and illiquid components of both on- and off-balance sheet items of stress test and non-stress test banks. It appears that stress test banks increase their savings deposits following the stress tests. Table A5 in the Appendix shows that savings deposits account for a large proportion (around 70–80%) of stress test banks' total liquid liabilities. With a decline in liquidity mismatch as a result of the reduction in asset-side liquidity creation, banks may rely more on stable funding sources, which leads to an increase in liability-side liquidity creation. Furthermore, Cornett et al. (2020) report that stress test banks increase their capital ratios to avoid failing the stress tests. With the improved capital ratios and the reduced probability of default, banks may have incentives to increase liquidity creation on the liability side of the balance sheet. This can subsequently lead to enhanced bank profitability, which may compensate for the forgone profits from the reduced asset-side liquidity creation. Enhanced profitability may also result in increased retained earnings and capital. Consistent with our results, Berger et al. (2016) find that capital support, which improves banks' capital ratios increases bank liability-side liquidity creation. It should be noted that equity is also included in the calculation of liability-side liquidity creation and the increased equity should reduce LCL. Therefore, it is not clear whether or not banks issue more equity in response to regulatory stress tests.\\nTable 5 reports the RD estimation results for those banks that enter the stress tests for the first time. In all regressions, Stress is the dummy variable which is equal to 1 if the bank is required to participate in the stress test in a particular year but not the year before, and is equal to 0 otherwise. Similar empirical findings are reported indicating that stress tests lead to a reduction in bank total liquidity creation. Specifically, Table 5 presents evidence that for those banks that enter the stress tests for the first time, they tend to cut down on asset-side liquidity creation to reduce their risk exposure while adjusting funding activities to increase liability-side liquidity creation. Consistent with prior empirical findings, banks' off-balance sheet liquidity creation is also reduced in response to regulatory stress tests. When controlling for the covariates, the estimated coefficients of Stress remain consistent across the model specifications. Taken together, the empirical results suggest that regulatory stress tests have a positive or negative impact on different components of liquidity creation, but the total effect is negative.\\nTable 5.

Bank liquidity creation when they enter the stress test for the first time\\nIn this subsection, we investigate the change in banks' liquidity creation as they enter the stress tests for the first time. The following regression is estimated using the ordinary least squares (OLS). To improve their chances of passing the stress tests, banks may manage their financial statements, thereby changing their liquidity creation. We follow Cornett et al. (2020) and estimate:\\n(2)\\nwhere Yit is the measure of bank liquidity creation for bank i at time t. The dummy variable of interest is First Stress, which takes a value of 1 if the bank is subject to the stress test in a particular year, but not the year before. Xit is a vector of control variables. All the variables are measured as changes from the periods just before entering into the stress tests to the first year of stress testing. Because the starting point of each of the stress tests is in the third quarter, the focus of the analysis is the changes during the third quarter prior to each of the stress tests and the first year of the stress test. The analysis allows us to identify the difference-in-difference (DiD) between stress test banks and non-stress test banks as they enter the stress tests for the first time. In all of our regressions for this subsection, time fixed effects are included and standard errors are double clustered by both bank and time to control for unobserved heterogeneity within the variables.10\\nTable 6 presents the results from the OLS regressions of bank liquidity creation measures as they enter the stress tests for the first time. The variable of interest is First Stress, which is equal to 1 if the bank is subject to the stress test in a particular year but not the year before. This allows us to examine the differences in the liquidity creation of non-stress test banks and stress test banks as the latter enters the stress tests for the first time. All the variables are measured as changes from quarter 3 of the year t − 1 to quarter 3 of year t as the starting point of the stress tests is quarter 3. Controlling for other bank-specific characteristics, the estimated coefficient of First Stress of −0.0843 is statistically significant at the 5% level in the regression (1) for total liquidity creation, LC. This suggests that as banks participate in the stress test for the first time, they tend to alter their behaviors and reduce their total liquidity creation from quarter 3 prior to joining the stress test group to quarter 3 in the first year of stress testing. Similarly, in the regression for the liquidity creation on the balance sheet, LCON, as banks enter the stress tests, there is a significant (at the 1% level) reduction in the liquidity creation of banks on the balance sheet with an estimated coefficient of −0.0303. Similar findings are presented in columns (3) and (4) for liquidity creation off the balance sheet, LCOFF, and asset liquidity creation, LCA. The coefficient estimates of First Stress are −0.0540 and −0.0232, respectively. The reduction in the asset-side liquidity creation, LCA, that is found in the table is consistent with the risk-management hypothesis proposed by Acharya et al. (2018). The hypothesis suggests that stress test banks manage their risk exposure more prudently by reducing credit supply, particularly to risky borrowers to increase their capital ratios. Furthermore, Table 6 shows that the risk-management hypothesis also applies to liquidity creation off the balance sheet because banks adjust their off-balance sheet activities as they enter the stress tests. Nevertheless, as for the liability-side liquidity creation, LCL, the estimated coefficient on First Stress is statistically insignificant even though it remains negative in column (5).\\nTable 6.

Bank liquidity creation around the stress test quarter\\nFrom 2009 to 2015, the starting point of the stress test is the third quarter, Q3, while the starting point of the stress test in 2016 is the first quarter, Q1. We examine the liquidity creation of stress test banks around the starting point of the stress tests by employing a DiD regression method following Cornett et al. (2020). At the starting point of the stress tests (i.e., Q = t), all the variables are measured as changes from quarter 2 to quarter 3 in 2009–2015 and from quarter 4 to quarter 1 in 2016. Similarly, we measure the changes in all the variables in the quarters before (i.e., Q = t − 2 and Q = t − 1) and after the starting point quarters (i.e., Q = t + 1). In all regressions, the variable Stress, which is equal to 1 if the bank participates in the stress test in a particular year and 0 otherwise, is the focus of our interest. The coefficient of the interaction between Stress and the quarters around the starting points of the stress tests captures the behavior of stress test banks around the stress tests. In all regressions conducted for this subsection, time fixed effects are included and standard errors are double clustered by bank and time to control for unobserved heterogeneity.\\nIn this subsection, we empirically examine the liquidity creation of banks around the stress test starting points. Table 8 presents the regression results for changes in bank liquidity creation by quarters around the stress test starting points. The interaction variable, Stress × Q = t, captures the effect of stress testing on the starting point quarters (between quarters 2 and 3 in 2009–2015, and between quarter 4 in 2015 and quarter 1 in 2016), Stress × Q = t + 1 isolates the changes in liquidity creation in the quarter after the starting points (between quarters 3 and 4 in 2009–2015, and between quarter 1 and 2 in 2016). Stress × Q = t − 2 and Stress × Q = t − 1 isolate the changes in liquidity creation two quarters and one quarter before the stress tests, respectively.\\nTable 8.

Stress is the dummy variable, which is equal to 1 if the bank is subject to the stress test in a particular year and 0 if it is not. The interaction term, Stress × Q = t, isolates changes in the measures of liquidity creation in the stress test starting point quarter (changes between quarter 2 and quarter 3 in 2009–2015 and between quarter 4 and quarter 1 in 2016). Stress × Q = t + 1 captures changes in quarter after the stress tests (between quarter 3 and quarter 4 in 2009–2015 and between quarter 1 and quarter 2 in 2016. Stress × Q = t − 1 captures changes in quarter preceding the stress tests (between quarter 1 and quarter 2 in 2009–2015 and between quarter 3 and quarter 4 in 2015) and Stress × Q = t − 1 isolates the changes in two quarters preceding the stress tests. All variables are measured as changes from t − 1 to t. Time fixed effects are included in all regressions and robust standard errors reported in parentheses are double clustered by bank and time. LC is the liquidity creation, LCON is the on-the balance sheet liquidity creation measure, LCOFF is the off-balance sheet liquidity creation, LCA is the asset component of liquidity creation, LCL is the liability component of liquidity creation, SIZE is the natural logarithm of gross total assets, CAP is the equity to total assets, ROE is the return on equity, and NPL is the total non-performing loans to total loans. ⁎⁎⁎, ⁎⁎, and ⁎ denote statistical significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels, respectively.\\nConsistent with prior empirical findings, it can be seen that the coefficient estimates of Stress × Q = t are negative and statistically significant for all measures of liquidity creation, except for LCL, indicating that banks reduce their liquidity creation at the starting points of the stress tests to improve their chances of passing the tests. The findings point to differences between stress and non-stress test banks at the starting point of the stress tests as liquidity creation of stress test banks is reduced in comparison with that of non-stress test banks. Specifically, the coefficient estimate of Stress ×Q = t for LC is −0.0125 and significant at the 1% significance level. The coefficient estimates of Stress × Q = t for LCON and LCOFF are −0.0034 and −0.0091, respectively (significant at the 1% and the 5% levels), indicating that stress testing appears to have a stronger effect on off-balance sheet liquidity creation of banks than on-balance sheet liquidity creation. The results are consistent with prior empirical analyses in which evidence in support of the risk-management hypothesis is reported. Stress test banks cut down their risk exposure, thereby reducing liquidity creation both on- and off-the-balance sheet. While the coefficient estimate for LCA is −0.0034 and significant at the 5% level, the coefficient estimate for LCL is statistically insignificant at conventional levels. For the quarters after the stress test starting points, Table 8 also shows that the coefficient estimates of Stress × Q = t + 1 are negative and statistically significant at the 5% level for only LCON and LCA (−0.0090 and −0.0064, respectively). Thes empirical results indicate that the impact of regulatory stress tests on bank liquidity creation appears to be strongest at the starting quarter of the stress tests as banks reduce their liquidity creation to improve the chances of passing the stress tests. The impact of stress tests on liquidity creation on the quarter after the stress tests is more pronounced but is only observed in some components of liquidity creation.\\nTable 9 presents the results after excluding the first stress test. The coefficient estimates on Stress × Q = t are slightly smaller than those reported in Table 8, but they are still negative and statistically significant at the 5% or 1% level for LC, LCON, and LCA.\\nTable 9.

Robustness checks\\nFor robustness checks, we begin with testing the parallel trends assumption, which in our case implies that in the absence of the stress tests, the trend growth rates for the liquidity creation measures of stress test and non-stress test banks are not statistically different. Table 10 presents t-tests for differences in mean between treatment and control groups in eight quarters prior to the stress test following Roberts and Whited (2013). The test examines the differences in the growth rate in liquidity creation measures between the treatment and control groups during each pre-treatment quarter. We find that the null of equality of means cannot be rejected in 34 out of 40 cases at conventional levels, which largely confirms the validity of the parallel trends assumption.\\nTable 10.

The local randomization assumption holds that, within a narrow bandwidth around the threshold, observations are as good as randomly assigned to treatment and control groups. That is, the treatment assignment could be regarded as a randomization mechanism near the cutoff (Lee, 2008). Following the procedure in Cattaneo et al., 2015, Cattaneo et al., 2016, a small neighborhood around the cutoffs where the local randomization assumption is deemed most plausible is selected. Table 11 presents the results of the difference-in-means tests for the measures of liquidity creation between the stress test banks and the non-stress test banks using the randomization inference. The estimates of the treatment effects are largely consistent with our main findings. For example, the difference in the means of LC between stress test and non-stress test banks is statistically significant at the 1% significance level.\\nTable 11.

The following alternative thresholds other than $100 and $50 billion are selected: $40, $60, $70, $80, $90, and $110 billion. Using the alternative thresholds as the artificial cutoffs, all banks in the sample are re-assigned into the treatment or the control groups, based on whether or not the banks' gross total assets exceed the artificial cutoffs, respectively. Table 12 presents the estimation results using the alternative cutoffs. Using the alternative cutoff of $40 billion, the estimated coefficient of Stress is negative in column (3). Using the alternative cutoff of $60 billion, even though the estimated coefficients of Stress are negative for LCA in both columns (7) and (8), we find that the estimated coefficient is positive for LC in column (2). Overall, the results suggest that the treatment effect is not observed at the artificially determined thresholds in most regressions.\\nTable 12.

Concluding remarks\\nIn this paper, we investigate the impact of Federal Reserve stress tests from 2009 to 2016 on U.S. bank liquidity creation. To do so, we employ a regression discontinuity approach to provide evidence that regulatory stress tests may lead to a reduction in bank liquidity creation both on and off the balance sheet. In particular, we show that asset-side liquidity creation decreases in response to the stress tests, a finding that is in line with the risk-management hypothesis: stress test banks cut down credit lending, particularly to risky borrowers, to reduce their risk exposures (Acharya et al., 2018). However, on the liability-side there is an increase of liquidity creation, driven by more customer deposit funding. This finding suggests that banks seek to offset the increase in funding costs resulting from the stress tests by moving from non-deposit funding to cheaper funding sources.\\nFrom a policy perspective, to the extent that stress testing discourages bank liquidity creation, an important bank output which contributes to economic growth (Bhattacharya and Thakor, 1993), stress tests might lead to a reduction in the amount available for financing, thereby slowing economic growth. Nevertheless, as excessive liquidity creation increases the probability of default (Imbierowicz and Rauch, 2014), which can result in financial instability and may lead to financial crises (Acharya et al., 2011; Acharya and Naqvi, 2012; Berger and Bouwman, 2017), the reduction of excessive liquidity creation as a consequence of regulatory stress tests can be socially desirable in terms of enhancing the safety and soundness of the banking system. For these reasons, it is important for policymakers and bank regulators to consider the trade-off between the benefits of greater financial stability and the benefit of greater liquidity creation when designing a regulatory framework that promotes the soundness of the banking system but also minimizes the impact on economic activity.\\nAcknowledgements\\nWe are grateful to Douglas Cummings (the Editor), two anonymous reviewers, participants at the IFABS 2019 Angers Conference, presentation participants at the University of Nottingham, the University of Glasgow, and Simona Mateut for useful comments and suggestions.\\nAppendix\\nTable A1. Summary of the literature on the effects of stress tests on banks' behaviors.\\nAuthor(s) Stress tests Findings\\nAcharya et al. (2018) SCAP & CCAR Those banks that are subject to the stress tests cut down their credit supply, particularly to relatively risky borrowers, thereby bringing down credit risk. Banks became safer in terms of capital ratios as well as risk-weighted asset ratios.\\nBerrospide and Edge (2019) CCAR Stress tests reduce commercial and industrial and small business lending. However, firms' overall debt, investment spending, and employment are largely unaffected.\\nBindal et al. (2020) DFA Banks that are right below the size threshold increase the likelihood of doing acquisitions and the number of acquisitions.\\nBordo and Duca (2018) DFA The passage of the DFA has induced a reduction in banks' lending to small businesses.\\nBouwman et al. (2018) DFA Those banks that are near below certain thresholds have incentives to alter their behaviors to avoid crossing the thresholds and incurring greater regulatory costs. These behaviors include growing assets and credits more slowly and charging higher interest rates on commercial loans.\\nCalem et al. (2019) CCAR The 2011 CCAR resulted in a decrease in the share of jumbo mortgage originations of stress-test banks and the effect was more pronounced for weakly capitalized banks.\\nConnolly (2018) SCAP Stress-test banks shift their lending toward relatively safer firms after the SCAP. Stress-test banks are found to be less likely to enter into new syndicated loans after the first stress test, which led to a change in the composition of syndicate members away from tested banks. However, the overall borrowing and firm outcomes were not dramatically affected.\\nCornett et al. (2020) SCAP & CCAR A significant increase in capital ratios for stress-test banks at the starting point of the tests but not for non-stress test banks is reported. Banks that are subject to the stress tests also reduced their dividends considerably more than non-stress test banks as they entered the tests. Stress-test banks have incentives to spend on lobbying activities significantly more than non-stress test banks.\\nCortés et al. (2020) CCAR An increase in interest rates and a reduction in credit supply to small businesses is documented. The loan portfolios of stress-test banks are also rebalanced away from riskier borrowers. Small non-stress test banks increased their market share, and the aggregate credit remained unchanged.\\nDoerr (2019) SCAP & CCAR Stress test banks reduce lending to small businesses, which negatively affects entrepreneurship and innovation by young firms.\\nEber and Minoiu (2017) ECB's Comprehensive Assessment Eurozone banks shrank their assets, particularly securities in anticipation of stricter supervision and the CA program. A decline in loan supply is found for only banks with low levels of capital.\\nGropp et al. (2018) 2011 EBA Capital Exercise Stress-test banks reduce their risk-weighted assets including loans to both corporate and retail customers instead of raising their levels of equity to increase capital ratios.\\nKovner and Van Tassel (2018) DFA Banks' cost of capital has fallen after the passage of the DFA, implying a decrease in banks' systematic risk.\\nLambertini and Mukherjee (2016) SCAP & CCAR Stress test failure resulted in higher loan spreads, pointing to the cost associated with increased capital requirements.\\nPierret and Steri (2018) CCAR & DFA The CCAR exercises reduce excessive risk-taking by enhancing banks' level of supervision and highlight the importance of bank supervision that cannot be substituted by stringent capital requirements in promoting prudent lending.\\nShahhosseini (2015) SCAP & CCAR To meet the capital requirements of the stress tests, banks restructured by reducing their net loan charge-offs and increasing non-performing loans, leading to increases in loan loss provisions and loan loss reserves.\\nTable A2.
