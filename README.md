The role was mainly focused on extracting data from journals.
Based on the Journal and the html of the website different methods were used to extract the data.

## Method-1
For the Journal of corporate finance in the science direct website, the links of the articles were collected first and then each of the link is parsed to extract the data.

## Method-2
For extracting data from Review of finance journal the webiste is parsed in such a way that a human is parsing.
Getting into each volume then getting into one of the issues and then getting into the articles in them and moving back to another issue once all the artiles are parsed.
This approach is time consuming but this doesnt require creating new functions to get the links of issues and articles.
